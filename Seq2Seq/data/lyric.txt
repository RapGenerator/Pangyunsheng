[00:12.00]他们说年轻人要努力 要多去想点主意
[00:15.00]他们劝你怎么都好就是别去跟钱赌气
[00:17.00]别再呆在家里愁 被压力压扁头
[00:20.00]想混口饭就乖乖跟人**后头刮点油
[00:23.00]万能的开门砖 满世界都围着转
[00:25.00]你要把钞票堆成山 至少家里塞一半
[00:28.00]那怎么才叫赚到够 他说要赚够来世用的
[00:31.00]说除了口袋装的其他都是白日梦
[00:33.00]你别不服气 有钱的才有福利
[00:35.00]被牵着鼻子走也心甘情愿当个***
[00:38.00]追名逐利  肝脑涂地 动着脑筋
[00:40.00]要把话说的好听
[00:42.00]还要服从钱的每个指令活着就得小心
[00:45.00]脸色要看得准
[00:46.00]什么事都办的稳
[00:47.00]他问你尊严能值几个钱你干嘛站着等

[01:43.00]有种人为了发财什么脏活都能干
[01:45.00]梦想就是在家数钱最好不用出门赚
[01:49.00]还有种人 不在乎为钱说了多少谎话
[01:52.00]有种人收着黑心钱 有种人脱光躺下
[01:55.00]有种人脸都不要
[01:56.00]为钱跟家里胡闹
[01:57.00]有种人赚着奶粉钱 却卖着***
[01:59.00]有种人觉得家里没钱让他特别丢脸
[02:02.00]要面子 要里子 却没办法两者都选
[02:04.00]就只好违背良心
[02:06.00]低声下气只为换取更多黄金
[02:09.00]真心话说给墙听
[02:10.00]像***在连吃必须不间断的投币
[02:12.00]都很傻很天真觉得会赢这场游戏

[00:15.11]我想把你留在这里
[00:18.38]我想把你留在这里
[00:20.16]我想把你留在这里
[00:22.56]
[00:30.38]如果真的会有一条直的路
[00:32.39]如果可以一直带着少年时的酷
[00:34.84]如果英雄真的不问出处
[00:36.71]真心不怕辜负
[00:37.94]誓言不怕美人迟了暮
[00:39.81]
[00:40.10]如果时间追你可以真的跑得掉
[00:42.38]如果失去不会让你脸上少了笑
[00:44.83]如果没有得到尊重不会让你开口吵着要
[00:47.87]如果丢了自己还能找得到
[00:49.96]
[00:50.13]如果有些妥协变成枷锁
[00:52.24]如果必须要跟新的世界搭伙
[00:54.71]如果不怕那些骄傲有天被人放在角落
[00:57.82]如果相信沙漠里能开出花朵
[01:00.19]
[01:00.47]如果你付出的所有都会被人记住
[01:02.97]如果现实淡了回忆没人听你细诉
[01:05.50]可惜时间带走一切变得天翻地覆
[01:07.97]想要把你留在这里  给你庇护

[01:28.19]把你留在身边不管走了多远
[01:30.87]
[01:30.99]这过程太快还来不及去留底
[01:33.10]没办法奢求但我也感谢有你
[01:35.75]或许在往后生命再没有交集
[01:38.19]风吹进窗户天空也下着小雨
[01:40.46]
[01:40.82]情绪被牵动 这增添了几分诗意
[01:43.34]再回头看看 不过一时之气
[01:45.95]也有过后悔 选择性失忆
[01:48.43]想把你留下 这想法也不切实际
[01:50.94]
[01:51.12]像手里握着的沙 问你还记得吗
[01:53.39]谁能陪你留下 我说过或许是他
[01:56.10]那是好是坏到底如何评估
[01:58.49]散落的记忆像撕碎的情书
[02:00.91]
[02:01.12]当不再天真 或许是成长
[02:03.71]回到那个房间已经布满蜘蛛网
[02:05.96]问我的感受？ 我说它像场梦
[02:08.64]但过了很久依旧还保留那份感动
[02:10.95]
[02:11.25]想要把你留在这里
[02:13.67]想要把你留在这里
[02:16.14]想要把你留在这里

[01:52.020]它跟你想的好像有点不太一样
[01:54.590]你发现自己上了自己的当
[01:57.020]于是学着察言观色
[01:58.520]学着适应那种根本不真实的欢乐
[02:01.050]也大手大脚花费 跟混混勾肩搭背
[02:03.620]也有过投机取巧 在路上偷偷插队
[02:06.560]你有天想起

[00:11.900]宿命是上帝为你写的剧本
[00:14.300]教会你如何去爱去恨
[00:16.800]天堂为每个人都打开了大门
[00:19.530]善恶是门票不分身份
[00:22.360]宿命也是你自己写的剧本
[00:25.000]自己选择自己要的人生
[00:27.850]信仰就是你心里的指南针
[00:32.62]Verse1：
[00:33.61]hey boy 你看世界用左眼还是右眼
[00:36.32]你对是非的判断是否只有对错之选
[00:38.84]我听说这个时代好像需要信仰
[00:41.72]那你信什么 上帝 金钱 还是你只信英特网
[00:44.69]这世界上有两种人 聪明人跟笨蛋
[00:47.35]我两者皆是所以大脑常会混乱
[00:50.90]看前者坐享其成因为笨蛋会找到办法
[00:52.73]聪明人要做的就是找到笨蛋在哪
[00:55.22]比如军火走私犯被拿下武器全部充公
[00:58.20]然后它们又被卖给非洲或者是中东
[01:00.77]当杀戮发生没法想象场面多么惊人
[01:03.51]但这时 他们站出来又把它放进新闻
[01:06.90]奇怪的是 在新闻里你不会看到不幸
[01:09.33]你笃定 这是个无比美好的环境
[01:12.00]你也许知道奢侈品的消费利润弹性
[01:14.88]但不会看到多少人为混口饭在玩命
[01:17.00]Hook：

[01:34.77]信仰就是你心里的指南针
[01:37.25]
[01:37.43]Verse2：
[01:39.92]如果女娲没有造人 牛顿没发现苹果
[01:42.41]如果那些大规模战争还没有停火
[01:45.28]那是否 这世界也就不会有困惑
[01:48.23]看那些经历遭遇的人 要如何振作
[01:51.20]当你在恼火没有买到 复刻的新鞋
[01:53.80]但有人出生就被没收视力还有听觉
[01:56.61]当你在西式餐厅挑剔 螃蟹的个子
[01:59.55]世界的另个角落里有孩子正被饿死
[02:02.90]我没有夸张 只是把现实扒的精光
[02:04.70]让你看它的**看我们也活在冰箱
[02:07.88]一面是冷酷 一面 是温暖的欺骗
[02:10.21]不断试探它的底线何时会达到极限
[02:12.87]god bless u 带你度过每个难关
[02:15.99]要奋力保持往前哪怕会脚步蹒跚
[02:18.65]你生活寒酸 像靠着破船上的栏杆

[00:23.91]JONY J：
[00:24.77]比他们都领先让他们红了眼
[00:28.80]又没跟他们炫我真的没时间
[00:32.31]我每分每秒都往前当然会走更远
[00:36.23]葡萄很甜
[00:38.14]别打了脸
[00:42.84]我在新的领域散步
[00:44.24]新的高度让我看到新的万物
[00:46.24]吃点金币再顺便帮你探路
[00:48.10]不止衣服鞋子 灵感也会给我赞助
[00:49.90]yep
[00:50.77]早就屏蔽了那些满嘴情谊却躲在背后阴你的人物
[00:53.76]yep
[00:54.58]在我经历过的之后可以轻易做到他们没法拼比的程度
[00:57.90]当你开始变的让人羡慕
[00:59.37]总是会有一帮说着风凉话的怨妇
[01:01.28]他们在你面前一副看不上的面目
[01:03.10]嘴里都是各种不屑心里却想得到眷顾
[01:05.36]我的成功变成了他们的痛处
[01:07.35]明白人总是爱比较的动物
[01:09.42]但是嫉妒是来自弱者无力的控诉
[01:12.00]活着是为了创造不是为了胜负
[01:14.07]每个人都生的很普通
[01:15.87]哭哭啼啼来到尘世中
[01:17.66]都想剑走偏锋甚至大闹天宫
[01:19.76]学个72变变成孙悟空
[01:21.72]但是过程有多难他们没想到
[01:23.72]发现做不到了就说不想要
[01:25.68]他们怕被唾弃
[01:26.68]只好装作阔气
[01:27.69]还会说你作弊
[01:28.74]盼你早点过气
[01:29.69]so cheap
[01:31.49]比他们都领先让他们红了眼
[01:35.61]又没跟他们炫我真的没时间
[01:39.23]我每分每秒都往前当然会走更远
[01:43.09]葡萄很甜
[01:45.05]别打了脸
[01:47.32]鬼卞：
[01:48.40]我想要的都会得到
[01:50.35]有人却笑我太过可笑
[01:52.31]说我站得太高 朋友太少 胜利等于徒劳
[01:56.53]冠军的项链只有一条
[01:58.20]对你来说过于沉重似乎没有必要
[02:00.31]但我早已做上记号 运用我的技巧
[02:02.73]走在你所不敢走的那条阳关大道
[02:04.78]畏手畏脚
[02:06.19]胆小的只能躲在角落乞讨吃剩的葡萄
[02:09.08]可能是致命的毒药
[02:10.69]但是毒不死我的我会全部吃掉
[02:14.20]你想尝都尝不到
[02:16.20]那种味道一刀一刀萦绕大脑
[02:18.50]只好嘴角挤笑 别再无理取闹
[02:21.38]走了那么久 故事才会有
[02:25.45]举着你的手 向我磕着头
[02:29.65]你不会知道我还没有赢够
[02:33.46]喝葡萄酿的酒
[02:37.69]比他们都领先让他们红了眼
[02:41.71]又没跟他们炫我真的没时间
[02:45.29]我每分每秒都往前当然会走更远
[02:51.23]别打了脸

[00:45.33]我只想让你不再为我流泪
[00:48.73]没有你的时光我变成酒鬼
[00:52.43]无解的孤独让我怎么收尾
[00:55.83]可只有你让我愿意卑微
[00:59.32]多希望你也会埋下伏笔
[01:01.75]来引起我注意
[01:03.59]让我的心触地
[01:05.68]可你又在哪里 babe
[01:09.26]原来只是我以为
[01:12.16]还能去散个步聊一整路
[01:14.36]没有拘束因为你
[01:16.30]Like a crew
[01:17.25]风雨无阻

[02:08.18]Verse.2
[02:08.59]JonyJ:
[02:09.01]你总是盘旋在我脑海里面
[02:12.57]想跟你缠绵一直到路灯熄灭
[02:16.01]你在我身边说可以放弃体面
[02:19.56]我装没听见还越来越没底线
[02:23.29]这几年像个失了控的小野兽
[02:25.43]玩的快要着魔
[02:26.88]游走在肉欲的丛林中
[02:29.01]可是内心一直漂泊
[02:30.50]身边总是留个空但是从不缺
[02:32.40]对我来说都是风景
[02:34.05]如果不是因为我写的歌选的路
[02:35.85]他们肯定早就不见踪影
[02:37.52]我知道物欲中酷与疯要怎么选择
[02:40.90]我知道恋爱中的很多人的忠诚都是演的
[02:44.65]我承认我害怕疼才把头用力点着
[02:48.16]反正我已经在这条路上走了这么远了
[02:51.75]太多情的便利店
[02:53.84]门开着没法藏
[02:55.14]我知道也许有一天我也会为了谁打烊
[02:58.70]但不是现在我像是掉拍没卡上
[03:02.23]我盼着那天可以早点来却总是鬼打墙
[03:05.84]你总是盘旋在我脑海里面

[00:12.170]
[00:16.170]吃完这份早餐 看完这本杂志 就走
[00:23.730]离开这座小城 有太多回忆的 路口
[00:31.160]爸妈在等候
[00:33.080]那些 没能 团聚的时候
[00:39.340]我想要紧握
[00:41.070]那双 轻柔 厚重 的双手
[00:48.400]Home, Home I’m almost home for you
[00:56.210]Home, Home I’m almost home for you
[01:04.100]让我撕心裂肺或绝望的场面不多
[01:12.030]也会伤心难过又或者失落却不说
[01:19.800]能否再触碰 那些 细腻 温柔 的感受
[01:27.600]我知道你会 拥抱 亲吻 抚摸 我的脆弱
[01:36.980]Home, Home I almost home for you
[01:44.690]Home, Home I almost home for you
[01:52.710]Home, Home I almost home for you
[01:59.960]Home, Home I almost home for you
[02:09.220]很多习惯这段时间忘了做
[02:11.200]歌词里的思念也唱错
[02:13.210]飞到想要去的外面世界逛过
[02:15.190]现在迫不及待再次起飞降落
[02:16.860]开始刚到人生地不熟的城市想要合群脸上挂着笑
[02:19.810]经过几次错对几次破碎后才发现只有家会永远让我靠
[02:24.920]也许没有经历就不会成长
[02:26.960]不想承认但是有时很想
[02:28.940]没有想过孤独会跟我捆绑
[02:31.170]开始慢慢习惯眼前的人来人往
[02:33.090]因为这场冒险让我变的疯狂
[02:34.890]它让我的每次关心也变得匆忙
[02:37.090]家是不管我在多么远的远方
[02:38.880]永远有间只会属于我的空房
[02:41.270]i’m coming
[02:42.320]Home, Home I almost home for you
[02:49.810]Home, Home I almost home for you
[02:54.950]Hey 我回来了
[02:56.810]Babe I’ll be home I’ll be home I’ll be home
[03:05.130]Babe I’ll be home I’ll be home I’ll be home
[03:13.490]Babe I’ll be home I’ll be home I’ll be home

[00:31.91]又打来三十多个电话没有接
[00:35.49]还没写完的歌也不想接着写
[00:39.07]全世界 除了你 谁都不想约
[00:42.00]lady
[00:43.20]但我在你面前有点惭愧没你想的那么完美
[00:47.03]我是个不定时炸弹
[00:49.75]惹尽了麻烦
[00:51.51]才不敢沾你的花瓣
[00:54.29]你想安逸 我想玩
[00:58.16]你也知道我很疯
[01:00.68]
[01:00.88]活在这花花世界之中很普通
[01:04.51]有时你伤心难过其实我也懂
[01:07.59]对你笑 抱着你 心里却很空
[01:10.97]lady
[01:12.14]从不给你任何机会反对
[01:14.16]把话说的那么干脆
[01:16.02]不需要多余的转弯
[01:18.97]别问我打算我不可能给你答案
[01:22.59]你很难过 我很难
[01:27.27]我其实也喜欢有你在身边
[01:30.53]迷恋你的身材还有你的脸
[01:33.56]但我多情多到可以开家便利店
[01:37.22]却不能在我心里为你留房间
[01:40.96]no 那就做个冷血杀手
[01:44.48]插上麦克风的插头

[02:02.51]我是说你也许真的没有那么好
[02:04.27]那么乖 也没有看起来那么正派
[02:05.98]但我可能比你更加了解我自己
[02:07.90]像个怪兽 比你想的还要更坏
[02:09.67]心里有个怎么样都填不满的洞
[02:11.34]早就被人掏空了从不感觉痛
[02:13.36]不会像你看我这样把你看的那么重要
[02:15.57]所以对我再好也没有什么用
[02:17.28]随便发个脾气就把你轰走
[02:18.73]甚至从来都不关心你的存在
[02:20.55]像我这种人不值得拥有你

慢慢来
[by:冯咸鱼]
[00:32.04]ah 我慢慢来
[00:34.07]一步一个台阶我慢慢来
[00:36.98]好事多磨我慢慢来
[00:39.56]比以前更稳当地慢慢来
[00:41.54]按照我的节奏在慢慢来
[00:43.46]调整好的状态也在慢慢来
[00:45.71]虽然有时看起来像慢半拍
[00:47.73]但是我想要的全都在慢慢来 i know it
[00:50.10]慢 时间难免走的有点慢
[00:52.12]飞机晚点要等到九点半
[00:54.11]需要缓解的压力变成满血的杀气有点乱
[00:56.89]生活有时莫名的受挫 或是面对着诱惑
[00:59.10]快要变成了名利中被切碎的肉末
[01:01.41]还是相信我什么都会有
[01:03.64]只是有些东西来的可能有点慢
[01:05.54]自己选的路我选择靠我自己走
[01:07.34]对我来讲都是过程还没走到终点站
[01:09.52]有时候你急功近利 反而前功尽弃
[01:11.66]不如逍遥自在的慢慢来
[01:14.00]先去看清自己 再来看清局势
[01:15.05]等到万事俱备之后你再去摊牌
[01:17.73]有时我也不懂是好是坏 （都别急）
[01:20.18]拿什么定义成功失败（数学题）
[01:21.78]那些该是你的 你不找它 它会过来找你
[01:23.85]不管输赢 都保持这个姿态 slow
[01:26.12]（有人来拍照 要记住插袋）
[01:41.13]战利品我可以慢慢享用
[01:43.25]我的瓶颈期就把它当作缓冲
[01:45.12]一切都在我手里自己掌控
[01:47.15]面对迎面来的麻烦我有我的脚步晃动
[01:49.12]当你开始失去你的节奏
[01:50.88]跟你对手决斗你的拳头绝对会变得特别慢
[01:52.29]有时候你进度快的崩溃
[01:55.25]结果发现事半功倍已经打包好的所有计划
[01:56.47]最后还得换
[01:57.72]想要淡淡定定但是战战兢兢
[01:59.12]没法玩的尽兴 你盼着幸运 能在你身边降临 yeah
[02:01.98]能让你得意忘形 yeah
[02:04.60]所有我想要的东西
[02:06.55]现在全都在我身边还没到的也正在慢慢来

[02:11.18]那是我的慢慢来在帮我做安排
[02:13.52]那些嫌我慢的现在过来点我赞
[02:15.28]想要来我身边想要做我小伙伴
[02:17.18]成功的几率有多大你不用教我算
[02:19.14]有时像在飚车有时候也有点慢
[02:21.13]我在高空的钢索上逍遥阔步 yeah
[02:23.49]你看到的不是全部 yeah
[02:25.65]如果你只想要快点但是计划是计划
[02:27.81]变化一不小心就会堵在半路
[02:29.44]look

[02:58.60]关掉你的垃圾然后滚出我视线这次没在开玩笑 hum
[03:01.58]but all for my lady all for my homie
[03:04.11]我们齐心协力已经度过了危机
[03:06.06]如今我们吐字成金开始展示着魅力
[03:07.06]成功的版图已经有了清晰轨迹
[03:09.08]那些磨难已经一去不返
[03:11.37]不建议告诉你我长处你还在护短？
[03:13.11]我是漫步丛林的泰山你顶多算是树懒
[03:15.24]我的川流不息能淹没你快找木板
[03:17.16]被我吐痰
[03:17.96]你的实力还不足以挑衅我
[03:20.44]就算做梦你也没法搞定我
[03:22.12]和你的难兄难弟卷个半根缠点烟丝
[03:23.98]快点找个地方去躲一躲

My City 南京
[by:自然醒灬慢半拍]
[00:07.15]独白:我曾在这个角度看这个城市，万家灯火，五彩斑斓。
[00:14.34]那边是紫金山，这边是玄武湖，
[00:18.87]对面是这个城市里最高的建筑，从这里还可以看到认识她的那个餐厅，
[00:27.12]边上就是我经常去的那个球场，从这里还可以看到我跟金岛打过架的那个巷子，
[00:35.74]也曾经一帮人在上海路那边的小酒吧里面喝到吐过。
[00:41.70]我后面就是带很多人来到这个城市的火车站，我也在那里送走了很多人。
[00:50.35]这里每天有人来，有人走，这里每天都有无数个故事在发生。
[00:58.05]这里是我现在生活的城市--这里是南京。
[01:02.93]
[01:15.62]有一个地方，没人比你更加熟悉
[01:18.80]在它的每个角落都曾留下你的足迹
[01:21.44]有一个地方，你心中想要为他努力
[01:24.02]因为它是你的荣耀，也代表着你的根蒂
[01:26.83]而当你身在外，他是你第一张名片
[01:29.52]也是你身上写着永远扯不掉的标签
[01:32.18]你对他没法选择，这是上帝给的机会
[01:34.95]从出身就在你的身上留下他的气味
[01:37.58]你懂得，没法靠一些图片或者文字，就完全向谁描述出你爱的这个城市
[01:43.30]你试图想要剪辑些点滴的片段
[01:46.11]可太多故事还在延续，从不曾间断
[01:48.81]有太多习惯，包括所有衣食行住
[01:51.40]那每条小巷里的小吃你比谁都清楚
[01:54.02]没离开之前你不知道你有多爱它
[01:56.75]在离开之后发现身在外心却留在家
[01:59.32]This my city no matter where you go
[02:02.60]It' always beautiful
[02:04.98]Love this town you also loved to
[02:07.69]this is my city
[02:10.10]This my city no matter where you go
[02:13.49]It' always beautiful
[02:16.09]Love this town you also loved to
[02:19.00]this is my city
[02:20.98]my city
[02:22.04]NJC他是我第二个家
[02:23.90]我说过不能离开因为真的很爱他
[02:26.63]他给我留下太多回忆，太多美好和甜蜜
[02:29.64]可这几年的人事物也渐渐都在远离
[02:32.23]我也试过离开但我现在还在这
[02:35.04]还有太多事没完成，还有太多舍不得
[02:37.94]总是企盼能够，能做出一点成就
[02:40.43]这几年发生太多我快有点不能承受
[02:43.30]如果下次离开我就再也不会回来
[02:45.98]而这座城市给的回忆没什么能替代
[02:48.61]但它成了我的包袱，我背不起也甩不掉
[02:51.50]每当想到这里有时甚至都会睡不着
[02:54.17]我喜欢这里每个没下雨的早上
[02:56.93]走遍这里每条马路胡同和小巷
[02:59.57]我闭上眼都能够画出这城市的构图
[03:02.26]此时我的身后依然还是莫愁湖
[03:04.57]This my city no matter where you go
[03:07.69]It' always beautiful
[03:10.57]Love this town you also loved to
[03:13.43]this is my city
[03:15.51]This my city no matter where you go
[03:18.98]It' always beautiful
[03:21.31]Love this town you also loved to
[03:24.43]this is my city
[03:26.48]This my city no matter where you go
[03:29.90]It' always beautiful
[03:32.34]Love this town you also loved to
[03:35.42]this is my city
[03:37.49]This my city no matter where you go
[03:40.72]It' always beautiful
[03:43.39]Love this town you also loved to
[03:46.24]this is my city

Know My Style（Peach K Remix featuring Jony J）
[00:00.00] 作曲 : Cee/Jony J
[00:01.00] 作词 : Cee/Jony J
[00:04.27]Yeah
[00:07.01]Here’s another one
[00:11.92]Once again
[00:13.40]Verse 1
[00:15.95]他们还在猜我怎么玩着文字游戏
[00:17.70]Flow和韵脚都是怎么编排
[00:19.54]他们不懂如何凭着感觉就能行云流水
[00:20.60]含金量很高的歌词都是信手拈来
[00:23.02]从来都不觉得突出重围会有任何规则
[00:24.69]就是这么自信不管我比他们后到还是先来
[00:26.54]钻石在哪都会保持它的身价
[00:28.76]何况当你碰到比你更努力的天才
[00:31.19]拆开每个鼓跟拍子跳起舞
[00:33.09]在白纸上留下新的警世录
[00:34.64]让我埋了那些没有才华却还是
[00:36.63]待在排行榜名单上的钉子户
[00:38.34]丛林规则很残酷
[00:39.68]说的不是拍成真人秀的栏目
[00:41.25]我的出现只是给你提前做个预告
[00:43.40]把你刻板印象去掉顺便定个标杆给这游戏加点难度
[00:46.54]没有规则设定
[00:47.90]我的歌词总是带着我的个性
[00:49.42]在哪都是实力的存在不用寻觅着人脉
[00:51.68]给纸老虎们带去厄运
[00:53.94]很抱歉让suckers扫了兴
[00:55.23]砸你饭碗但让你们保了命
[00:56.89]随便闯祸我自己能搞得定
[00:58.75]四两拨千斤会用最巧的劲 my style
[01:01.87]Chorus
[01:02.17]We got K on the beat
[01:04.48]Jony J roll wit me
[01:05.21]唱着最棒的戏
[01:06.66]and all the way down the street(hold up)
[01:09.51]Y’all gon’ fuck with the J style
[01:11.11]Ghost whip whip down the 8 mile
[01:13.20]Y’all can’t never rock the Cee style
[01:15.10]这代表说唱的记号
[01:17.03]Now y’all know my style(y’all ready for my style)
[01:20.86]Now y’all know my style(y’all ready for my style)
[01:24.99]Now y’all know my style(y’all ready for my style)
[01:29.09]Now y’all know my style(y’all ready for my style)
[01:31.75]Verse 2
[01:32.05]写过的rhyme book 像是狂人日记
[01:33.68]让多少rappers 关起房门自闭
[01:35.91]让票房卖座 挤到让人窒息
[01:37.43]加速心跳脉搏 上演头文字D
[01:39.54]早已开足马力
[01:41.41]用这三寸不烂之舌 拍武打戏
[01:43.47]Got the pedal to the metal 在我身前没有对手
[01:45.42]开路先锋像台推土机在 拆除瓦砾
[01:47.53]Punch line多的像
[01:49.29]是信手捏来 有时甜言蜜语说的香
[01:50.73]有时仿佛那奔驰的野马脱了缰
[01:52.57]耍着文采好比相声界的郭德纲
[01:54.48]让文字更加赋有生命力
[01:56.47]在这固有的领地 无人能顶替
[01:58.37]时常措辞强烈需要几罐镇定剂
[02:00.20]从不轻易抛头露面行踪更隐秘
[02:03.27]精辟的押韵是标配
[02:04.38]所有形容比喻搭配的妖媚
[02:06.13]将这街头艺术发挥的高贵
[02:08.36]把你教会 和节奏大胆的交配
[02:10.13]用着我的强盗逻辑
[02:11.92]不断的屏蔽娱乐圈的娘炮萝莉
[02:13.63]不用再次强调这魔力
[02:15.72]Cuz I can’t stop the callin’…fallin’…
[02:18.05]Chorus
[02:18.35]We got K on the beat
[02:19.62]Jony J roll wit me
[02:21.02]唱着最棒的戏
[02:22.70]and all the way down the street(hold up)
[02:24.95]Y’all gon’ fuck with the J style
[02:27.66]Ghost whip whip down the 8 mile
[02:29.48]Y’all can’t never rock the Cee style
[02:31.35]这代表说唱的记号
[02:33.21]Now y’all know my style(y’all ready for my style)
[02:36.77]Now y’all know my style(y’all ready for my style)
[02:40.53]Now y’all know my style(y’all ready for my style)

[00:21.360]都说人生很短暂
[00:25.270]角色在不停转换
[00:26.950]有时候想要回头
[00:28.250]反而对以前不敢看
[00:30.230]就别只顾著感叹 其实那只一小段
[00:32.380]对自己保持期盼 是我习惯不留遗憾
[00:35.250]我时常 在睡著还在想著白天的事
[00:38.480]因为我睡在白天所以大脑从未停止
[00:41.300]我常常掉进深渊陷入想不通的事里
[00:44.580]很多事我都办不到比如说说服自己
[00:47.890]为什麽 有时候想哭却是笑的脸孔
[00:50.790]为什麽 想说点心事却发现没人懂
[00:53.770]为什麽 心痛有时痛过在身上穿孔
[00:56.860]为什麽 不原谅才是最大的尊重
[00:59.780]现实里有些烦恼措手不及不好躲
[01:02.820]我也有过恼火 只为灵感不来找我
[01:05.440]最完美的行程是你回头转脸看
[01:08.970]美好的沿途风景和幸福的终点站
[01:58.540]如果时间回到起点有机会让你重选
[02:02.670]你是否依然坚定当初选择不变
[02:05.380]总是怕做错又怕后悔不想跟自己再斗嘴
[02:08.340]挣扎在一线之间现实拖了梦想后腿
[02:11.700]今晚没有咖啡 也没有酒精
[02:14.510]只有冷冰的麦克握在我的手心
[02:17.500]躺著又睡不著觉 起来又觉得困
[02:20.830]好像怎麼都不对 实在是觉得闷
[02:23.830]说了一堆废话 最近想法太杂乱
[02:26.960]想整理好思绪 可是又怕麻烦
[02:29.910]翻以前的人生 想给自己点安慰
[02:32.820]可是想了一通却又更加地惭愧
[02:35.970]当初交代自己的话还能记得多少
[02:38.920]答应过自己的还有多少没做到
[02:41.820]别再胡思乱想了 想到就得去做
[02:44.720]good night baby明天还得过
[02:54.200]啦啦啦啦

[00:11.59]我习惯每天清晨拉开
[00:12.94]厚实的窗帘看莫愁湖发呆
[00:14.85]看楼下卖早餐的摊贩 遛狗的老太
[00:17.46]还有晴天都会穿着雨靴晨跑的老外
[00:20.37]我习惯 在太多餐厅都不能抽烟
[00:22.54]我习惯 在这里几乎没有春秋天
[00:25.20]我习惯 等睡着的堵车还有苏A的牌照
[00:27.80]NJ city 说着 欢迎你的来到
[00:30.43]习惯了这个怀抱
[00:31.64]习惯 最可怕 最可怕是爱上它
[00:34.00]而它现在已经是我第二个家
[00:36.45]可能得离开一阵子 但不管去到哪
[00:38.98]我都记得回来照顾好我窗台上的花

[01:16.76]是你们在我那段最落魄的时候
[01:19.22]帮我挡住了井口丢落下来的石头
[01:21.80]有太多的假朋友已经得到审判
[01:24.31]好了别再装了 就快点滚蛋
[01:26.97]迷失在夜里 结识了一些小人
[01:29.34]现在看清谜底 因为时间到了早晨
[01:32.10]还好有你们 让我看清让我学会
[01:34.35]任何的困难 都会陪我一起面对

[02:04.68]我不停的写歌 只唱给她听
[02:07.15]我想只有hiphop 她像个女孩
[02:09.75]给我一点时间 我现在想要表白
[02:12.20]就说你是** 一点不过分
[02:14.52]会让人上瘾 太多人可以作证
[02:17.24]他们都想戒 可没什么效果
[02:19.75]从Nas到Common 现在终于是轮到我
[02:22.27]有多少夜晚 你陪我一起度过
[02:24.44]对我的生命而言我想你绝对不止路过
[02:27.25]你已经变成印记刻在我内心最深处
[02:29.97]就像是tattoo hey girl 这真酷
[02:32.38]自从认识了你以后 改变了我太多
[02:34.80]穿着 说话 占据我所有生活

[00:36.55]手边上有个快捷键你难道还会忍住不用
[00:39.70]man 我才不相信
[00:41.13]脆弱的舒适圈能给你安全
[00:43.50]可能你最相信的人转眼就跟你翻脸
[00:46.23]面对着诱惑还能清醒淡定保持不变
[00:49.01]活在这钢铁丛林中不可能总是如愿
[00:51.85]漫漫长路
[00:53.68]又有谁能心无旁骛

[01:12.98]等你睁开眼你看到又是新的天地
[01:15.69]wow

[01:25.22]只当做生命体验不是为了那些所谓奖赏
[01:29.06]我拿到也没错
[01:30.31]我不像那些没本事的什么都没做
[01:32.95]我不会被人绑住手脚
[01:34.57]被欲望冲昏头脑
[01:35.99]守住我最爱的这一切
[01:37.64]目送你一路走好

[00:21.87]有种当面叫做交心的
[00:23.28]转身成了八卦
[00:24.40]再把模糊编成高清 连细节都要夸大
[00:26.77]透过不透风的墙壁到处满天飞着流言
[00:29.44]在不存在的交际圈里莫名背了头衔
[00:32.05]开门见山掏着心窝 红掌拨着青波
[00:34.61]以讹传讹 居然有种肯定叫做听说
[00:37.49]当交际中的消遣 显得更加合群
[00:40.01]都喜欢抱团扎堆制造表面上的和平

[00:44.75]一个个皮笑肉不笑的彼此呕着气
[00:47.42]你看他他看你 却像是隔着八万里
[00:49.68]盘算着要把无知装的多神秘
[00:51.81]跟对手拼着戏
[00:53.12]你们累不累 彼此都陪着演
[00:55.39]这世界这么大又不是没得选
[00:58.25]你选个家世比你显赫 以防江湖多么险恶

[01:26.98]看你把鬼话说的溜 就让你尽情做着秀
[01:29.64]一个嘴巴两个大
[01:31.01]聚三五成群讲个话
[01:32.31]一个个表面道貌岸然最多只敢网上骂
[01:34.98]都躲在自家盘丝洞里
[01:36.39]玩火的别怕玩失控
[01:37.75]如果能帮到你忙就尽管拿去当作谈资用
[01:40.12]不跟你收费
[01:41.22]收也算你优惠

[01:45.52]身边的鬼我清楚 有几个心腹
[01:48.19]有几个homie挺我 又养了几只鹦鹉
[01:51.00]都喜欢见风使舵 loser聚堆选个总舵

[00:05.179]从个零 变一
[00:16.767]再从个什百变亿
[00:18.679]像个从不停的 电梯
[00:20.430]没有极限没有边际
[00:22.325]不止要把名 变利
[00:23.888]还要开个新的天地
[00:25.770]他们只会评价 贬低
[00:27.710]却又这让一切变的更加绚丽
[00:29.501]一个念头在出现了之后就开始想
[00:31.553]种子在播下后开始长
[00:33.427]子弹都上膛后开了枪
[00:35.322]天生没有脚的鸟要不停拍翅膀
[00:36.964]没有回头路
[00:38.045]没有参照物
[00:38.904]没人知道目的地也不用立足
[00:40.449]穿过看不见的雾才浮现了路

[01:01.567]从来不管再难的路我迈着带感的步伐在挨完了白眼后终于走到
[01:05.657]来自一无所有
[01:06.946]不会担心本事被夺走
[01:08.482]我把钥匙攥在我手
[01:10.010]这一刻我等了多久
[01:11.636]从不相信小人物不会做到大
[01:14.445]英雄不问出生
[01:15.803]像是一颗小原子引起大爆炸
[01:17.652]你没看到变的过程
[01:19.214]一路上我控制情绪加密
[01:20.926]判断时机随时发力
[01:22.683]看清这形势中的差异
[01:24.559]开始行动连呼吸都带着杀气

[01:58.559]生长 保持 野蛮的个性
[02:00.726]我不管像神还是幽灵
[02:02.119]这条路走起来偏僻
[02:03.912]有时候会碰上很麻烦的天气
[02:05.668]如果没看过我眼神多坚毅
[02:07.426]没有人做到过我就是先例
[02:09.179]让我来开启个头
[02:10.544]造几个楼
[02:11.405]要走就帅气的走 围观的准备好拍你的手
[02:16.092]我不听窝囊废论足评头
[02:18.133]眼睛里只有我帅的镜头
[02:19.802]掠过了明枪暗箭的阴谋
[02:21.499]走远的乱世中一股清流

[01:33.91]我十七岁时出来混开始不在家里住
[01:39.18]我早就明白上帝他不会白白的给我发礼物
[01:42.07]想要得到就得付出
[01:43.50]很多时候必须要面对孤独
[01:45.42]别总是让自己过的舒服
[01:46.64]饥饿感push着新鲜出炉的新技能
[01:49.28]及时补充精气神
[01:50.74]保持对我信任的兄弟们
[01:52.25]已经开始准备新一轮
[01:53.71]总有人看起来他好像已经把一生都安排好认定了该认的命
[01:56.94]老子不信 长了颗孤傲的心
[01:58.98]大道理不抱着听
[02:00.14]独到的见解
[02:01.10]让我更孤僻
[02:01.75]从来都不屑
[02:02.47]他想要的出息
[02:03.17]爱我的别为我哭泣
[02:04.29]早就把污蔑跟误解都忽略不计
[02:05.86]不卑不亢
[02:07.03]总有人活得无望
[02:08.29]他们都以为你跟他们一样把钱看的至高无上
[02:11.08]随波逐浪
[02:11.89]所以我偏偏要推开这让他们觉得是冒险的门
[02:14.39]活着就要像个大写的人
[02:15.83]受了点伤
[02:16.60]也从来都不觉得疼
[02:17.65]越来越沉默
[02:18.75]才看到脉络在越来越清晰
[02:20.41]看那些无知的蠢货
[02:21.41]还在玩幼稚园学来的心机
[02:23.33]背地里老屁股在耍着阴招
[02:25.00]young nigga也跟着挑衅
[02:26.43]我只顾不断的达到我新高一路上一步步留下个脚印
[02:29.25]他们在抱怨着为什么上帝忘记给他们安排个好命
[02:32.13]绝境里学到了新招
[02:33.74]我什么都自己搞定

JONY J:
[00:21.55]有时候我是自己 有时候我是我
[00:23.89]他们是两个人 想分开我也尝试过
[00:26.49]一个是yes man 而另一个是恶魔
[00:29.14]一个是夜里的光 一个是刺眼的焰火
[00:31.80]两个不同人格却是同样的身份
[00:34.45]做不同的事业 常常不停在争论
[00:37.05]我什么 都认真 自己却满不在乎
[00:39.69]他们背道而驰 各持不同的态度
[00:42.54]他们也总是对方犯错的借口
[00:44.88]各自心怀鬼胎 像是背战的猎手
[00:47.88]赢得那个总是站在另一个背后
[00:50.48]深入敌后 却没有时间退守
[00:53.23]无数次对战后 
[00:54.57]胜负是各半
[00:55.91]他们无法摆脱对方 各自鸟兽散
[00:58.56]ER 不受控制的切换 
[01:01.16]杀死任何一个我都只是我的一半

[02:53.48]用青春去做賭注 我單調奪將
[02:56.08]用心最正確 就係選擇咗說唱
[02:58.62]現實唔買賬 現實系要靠賣相
[03:01.31]當局者迷 旁觀者清
[03:03.87]紙醉金迷 有人坐井官升

口袋里的秘密
[by:耳食之言]
[00:20.60]太多不為人知不能說出的險
[00:23.01]他的秘密是藏在相機背後的眼
[00:25.42]一張陌生的臉 嘴裡不時吐著煙
[00:28.03]太多沉默的故事掙扎流不出他筆尖
[00:30.80]寄希望于每個畫面 鏡頭的構思
[00:33.37]源源不斷的靈感總是提前被透支
[00:35.85]像詩人般寫不出字 像rapper寫不出詞
[00:38.61]可當靈感撲來時 又想要有所節制
[00:41.23]朋友用音符寫字 他靈感靠拼圖顯示
[00:43.70]用辛苦開發潛質 他不清楚如何解釋
[00:46.37]這鏡頭想說什麽不能直接告訴你
[00:48.83]不會刻意做噱頭 只用畫面抓住你
[00:51.39]有很多的想法 卻苦於沒有出口
[00:54.16]甚至他覺得沒有好的作品拿得出手
[00:56.68]他還守在那夢想的邊上不想走開
[00:59.61]怕讓人知道這秘密他藏進書包口袋
[01:02.22]口袋裡的秘密 是那少年的夢
[01:04.82]口袋裡的秘密 沒人理解多重要
[01:07.49]口袋裡的秘密 催他奮進的鐘
[01:10.00]口袋裡的秘密 不用其他人懂
[01:22.94]他不想讓人懂 可是又害怕沒人懂
[01:25.24]就像不想讓人哄 可是又害怕沒人哄
[01:27.91]他對自己很多懷疑 懷疑又否定
[01:30.74]否定之前得到的一切都是走運
[01:33.40]當你穿著鞋 他還在光著腳
[01:35.88]被釘子磨出血 他也都照常跑
[01:38.43]各種建議中成長不是靠一邊倒
[01:40.80]走的不快不慢感重點覺要剛剛好
[01:43.43]沒有捷徑只能一步步留下鞋印
[01:46.10]他帶了一包秘密 然後下了決定
[01:48.66]去到另個城市住 各種新鮮人事物
[01:51.20]打開新的地圖 確定他要走的路
[01:53.92]看這未知的一路 慎重的每一步
[01:56.52]是好是壞都要在走總之他不能停住
[01:59.18]口袋里的秘密是曾被嘲笑的夢想
[02:01.88]現在他也嘲笑他們不懂夢的重量
[02:04.53]口袋裡的秘密 是那少年的夢
[02:07.16]口袋裡的秘密 沒人理解多重要
[02:09.72]口袋裡的秘密 催他奮進的鐘
[02:11.99]口袋裡的秘密 不用其他人懂
[02:24.92]他答應過自己 說到的就要做到
[02:27.69]哪怕在旁人看來他就好像是吃錯藥
[02:30.06]當初朋友給的鼓勵 讓他一鼓作氣
[02:32.68]他拼命的努力 終於做出一點成績
[02:35.44]終於越來越在靠近 當初定的目標
[02:37.85]卻發現已經好久站原地定住了腳
[02:40.44]開始看不到自己 開始對自己滿意
[02:43.11]開始有點膨脹自負 開始放松了腳力
[02:45.59]只聽到掌聲遍地 卻聽不到中肯建議
[02:48.23]他的態度有了倦意 他以為已經建立
[02:50.90]足夠的地位高度 他漸漸有了包袱
[02:53.70]他心想我要hold住 現在能保持的收入
[02:56.26]就這樣停滯不前 模糊了最初的目標
[02:58.73]而他的秘密 還被藏在了舊書包
[03:01.63]無意中翻出來 發現已經上了銹
[03:04.12]他捧在手里靜靜看著沉默了很久
[03:08.13]

[00:15.18]记得那个时候很单纯
[00:16.99]不会感到压力也不觉得生活烦人
[00:19.75]只要作业能够完成
[00:21.62]就有大把的时间去看电视
[00:24.18]经常耍无赖 那时不懂爱面子
[00:26.71]时间飞跑 把平地跑成高楼
[00:29.39]下巴长了胡子开始对穿着有要求
[00:32.09]开始争强好斗 开始泡妞
[00:34.63]开始骑上摩托车也开始爱上篮球
[00:37.08]为自己编个理由 就可以去放纵
[00:39.50]叛逆在某个暑假出现青春在晃动
[00:42.08]so u 在烈日下游泳 叫上几个伙伴
[00:45.85]把衣服帽子鞋子可乐全都放在左岸
[00:48.32]那个夏天 发现身体有了变化
[00:50.94]有了心仪对象 每天都想要见她
[00:53.44]开始急着长大 想去外面世界冒险
[00:56.31]还不知道 人生有很多路要选
[00:58.69]有天偷偷喝了一罐啤酒 在某个晚上
[01:02.26]很多想法开始萌芽当胃部开始暖涨
[01:05.88]No no no
[01:08.50]I feel that everything's new and I'm cloaking a struggle
[01:13.35]My years are being punished as life goes fast and slow
[01:22.11]Unknown rows ,Unknown rules,undergo ,hot and cold
[01:31.27]and how I play my role
[01:35.40]It's kinda cruel when you think of what you dreamed to do
[01:40.28]Do you still remember how you feel
[01:45.68]光阴就似箭 你穿过无数日夜
[01:48.16]终于等到自己要去面对这个世界
[01:50.41]它跟你想的好像有点不太一样
[01:52.88]你发现你自己上了自己的当
[01:55.20]于是学着察言观色
[01:56.67]学着适应那种根本不真实的欢乐
[01:59.32]也大手大脚花费 跟流氓勾肩搭背
[02:01.84]也有过投机取巧 在路上偷偷插队
[02:04.77]你有天想起
[02:06.33]It's kinda cruel when you think of what you dreamed to do
[02:10.81]Do you still remember how you feel
[02:16.20]跟朋友通宵派对
[02:17.11]狂欢后又被灌醉
[02:18.27]憧憬过的未来难道就是用来浪费
[02:20.79]shit 灭掉手中的烟头 又开了一罐啤酒
[02:24.41]觉得人生就是一场赌博买定离手
[02:26.49]有天喝醉之后你做了一个梦
[02:29.36]看见火车站的广场上挂了一个钟
[02:31.88]它的时针 秒针 分针都在倒着走
[02:34.30]你的时光列车 在那里调了头
[02:36.87]一切都在还原 过去的景象
[02:39.48]高楼都变成了老区和平房
[02:42.16]看见了几年前的学校和银行
[02:44.52]崭新的篮球 初恋的对象
[02:47.10]在午后的巷子里跟伙伴们奔跑
[02:49.56]没有社会压力 没有纷纷扰扰
[02:52.13]再到开始认字 开始学着讲话
[02:54.65]停在咿咿呀呀不再急着长大
[02:57.17]It's kinda cruel when you think of what you dreamed to do
[03:03.11]Do you still remember how you feel


众人皆醉我独醒
[by:柯镇长]
[00:09.97]我睁开眼看世界开始有点乱
[00:12.23]所有人的言行举止全都开始减慢
[00:14.68]酒精弥漫在空气里大部分人被感染
[00:17.67]我在角落里观察像看小丑展览
[00:20.11]醉酒之人大部分都觉得自己清醒
[00:22.56]常常都自作聪明是他们的通病
[00:25.90]于是对和错的天平在他们那里失灵
[00:27.72]讨厌所有对立面 可他们并不知情
[00:30.14]谎言不一定假 真话也不一定对
[00:32.68]你身体是醒的 其实大脑还在睡
[00:35.60]我想弄清楚到底是什么在作祟
[00:37.59]我推开问号门的背后却发现是酒柜
[00:40.23]成堆的酒鬼也想把我灌醉
[00:42.74]别拉我下水 想拖我走 no way
[00:45.37]我才不想跟你一样 哪怕你是对的
[00:47.83]如果说你是醒的 ok 那是我醉了
[00:50.31]众人皆醉 可是醉的大多都是病人
[00:52.87]我独醒 我失去伙伴 可你失去信任
[00:55.35]众人皆醉 有人醉翁之意不在酒
[00:57.77]我独醒 我拥有的你已经不再有
[01:00.36]众人皆醉 浑浊的人群和城市
[01:02.95]我独醒 看谁在保持真实
[01:05.38]众人皆醉 所以我不需要你的计划
[01:07.94]我独醒 带你回到地下
[01:10.45]别用喝醉的眼睛来看我
[01:12.49]别问我什么地方和你不一样
[01:14.67]答案太多 我心里有数
[01:16.63]而你活得没流儿（不入流儿）
[01:18.30]没句实话在嘴里 早无药可救
[01:20.68]闷完了一口 感情到底多深
[01:23.15]酒后用酒话 想以假乱真
[01:25.67]社会的酒不醉人 人们自醉
[01:28.35]在幻觉的世界 需要清醒的智慧
[01:31.13]明明看不清周围 却能够听得清高兴的想听的恭维
[01:35.97]你没明白是你醉了 而我醒着
[01:38.32]所以在你身上看见了别人的影子
[01:40.91]如果你不知道什么才是真的自己
[01:43.45]那你不久就会死在我的歌里
[01:46.80]小心有小心眼儿挑你毛病
[01:48.53]记着去撒泡尿 瞧你多diu（满嘴瞎话）
[01:50.99]众人皆醉 可是醉的大多都是病人
[01:53.39]我独醒 我失去伙伴 可你失去信任
[01:55.85]众人皆醉 有人醉翁之意不在酒
[01:58.40]我独醒 我拥有的你已经不再有
[02:01.30]众人皆醉 浑浊的人群和城市
[02:03.49]我独醒 看谁在保持真实
[02:05.88]众人皆醉 所以我不需要你的计划
[02:08.55]我独醒 带你回到地下
[02:11.11]别想借着酒劲耍酒疯 我奉陪到底
[02:13.69]你像是被人控制了 我不跟你讲道理
[02:16.27]一直误会这个世界所以才喝醉
[02:18.65]你不想看清自己才会觉得自己都对
[02:21.26]一开始我想帮你 说醒醒你醒醒
[02:23.77]但你无药可救 那我就此图个清静
[02:26.30]别在用你谬论游说 像个病毒传销
[02:28.81]把欲望和贪婪放进自然里焚烧
[02:31.53]我不喝你的酒 不用冲我假笑
[02:33.64]我知道你的好意背后藏了什么圈套
[02:36.32]看你都醉成了这样还跟我谈什么承诺
[02:38.89]我继续保持清醒 还有好多事在等我
[02:41.41]还有更多的人在加入 等待能喝醉
[02:44.30]被拆掉的家 永远找不着的车位
[02:46.67]相信我们说的话 有天你会明白
[02:49.10]因为我们也是刚从宿醉中醒来
[02:51.52]众人皆醉 可是醉的大多都是病人
[02:54.00]我独醒 我失去伙伴 可你失去信任
[02:56.55]众人皆醉 有人醉翁之意不在酒
[02:59.50]我独醒 我拥有的你已经不再有
[03:01.57]众人皆醉 浑浊的人群和城市
[03:04.13]我独醒 看谁在保持真实
[03:06.52]众人皆醉 所以我不需要你的计划
[03:09.24]我独醒 带你回到地下

[00:12.82]HOOK:
[00:10.60]这一趟永不回头的时光列车
[00:12.80]载你奇妙旅行的时光列车
[00:14.37]只能选择一次的时光列车
[00:16.80]没后悔过搭上这趟时光列车
[00:20.49]Verse1:
[00:30.71]用生命做票根 用岁月记录里程
[00:32.85]终点站是哪里 有疑惑的不止你们
[00:35.35]从启程 到 停靠站从上流到底层
[00:37.83]但是你看看历史 能到达的又有几人
[00:40.56]年轻时这趟列车载你去远方
[00:42.84]一路上改变你的思想与眼光
[00:45.40]从对世界的认识只有几本书和电视
[00:47.79]直到你通过网络发现世界已经变质
[00:50.56]是否还记得那把玩具冲锋枪
[00:52.91]那你是否还向往童话里的乌托邦
[00:55.46]这一路换过几个车厢你换过几个梦想
[00:58.11]失去过多少心上人 失去过多少信仰
[01:00.58]但列车不曾停下 车轮在不断往前
[01:03.40]它带你离开过去然后碾碎所有谎言
[01:05.60]停靠站让你带走或是留下名誉声望
[01:08.27]你重新整理行囊 然后再次登上
[01:10.42]HOOK:
[01:10.81]这一趟永不回头的时光列车
[01:13.22]载你奇妙旅行的时光列车
[01:15.82]只能选择一次的时光列车
[01:18.20]没后悔过搭上这趟时光列车
[01:20.80]Verse2:
[01:30.88]这一路不断有人下车有人上车
[01:33.31]这车厢有人静坐冥想有人大声唱歌
[01:36.60]有人在眺望前方有人对来时路望着
[01:38.54]窗外风景相同为何心情不一样呢
[01:41.20]从孩童到青春到牙齿都掉光
[01:43.64]再没有重来一次没有不老的药方
[01:45.92]再多钱也不能买来心上人的芳心
[01:48.36]也不能买来幸福买来流失的光阴
[01:50.93]但有天这趟列车会带你回家乡
[01:53.85]说生命是个轮回 终点站都是天堂
[01:56.27]给老弱病残让位 站着比坐着有样
[01:58.73]是珍惜还是浪费 决定都在你手上
[02:01.25]等到日落黄昏 把影子拉的修长
[02:03.55]时光列车继续拉响鸣笛声悠扬
[02:06.00]你下车 挥手 这次不再跟进
[02:09.70]而它继续往前车上载满新的生命

[by:purpledrik]
[01:05.03]好沮丧 the Summer’s Gone 气温又降了 不知不觉又添了衣裳
[01:10.06]仲夏一个单薄的梦 像是纱做的蚊帐 被折叠成秘密封藏
[01:15.46]Oh u know the feeling the Summer’s Gone , my life becomes from fresh to dark brown
[01:20.54]想起那时的夜短昼长 热浪 似乎将我的青春期延长
[01:25.80]等待一场半夜的球赛 左手啤酒右手可乐都加满了冰块
[01:30.79]冰激凌听话的躺在冷柜 等着触碰我们干燥的唇和胃
[01:35.34]大口的喝水 一杯又一杯 每当汗流浃背 虚弱又颓废
[01:40.44]细胞，嗷嗷待哺张开了嘴 补充了能量继续PLAY DA GAME
[01:45.77]男孩迫不及待的跳进池塘 假装乘风破浪 水花肆意碰撞
[01:50.75]水鬼也被逼着上了岸 仿佛生的热气驱走了死的严寒
[01:56.34]天亮得早白天长 不用闹钟我也不会赖床
[02:01.13]冲凉 柠檬沐浴香
[02:03.78]裸露的皮肤 汗毛茁壮生长
[02:06.61]花露水的味道是种安心的清凉
[02:09.22]蚊虫的叮咬 挠了又挠的瘙痒
[02:11.60]泄气的大地 苦等着风 稠腻的晌午 人们寻找遮蔽行色匆匆
[02:17.20]躲在屋里 不用找别的借口
[02:19.48]你是我的解暑良药我的冰镇樱桃汽酒
[02:22.05]咽下一口 沿着我的食道四壁
[02:24.48]湿润粗糙的黏膜 沁入我的心脾
[02:37.70]我说真的时间他就是个小气鬼
[02:39.94]在半睡半醒之间多想让闹钟闭嘴
[02:42.52]这种感觉可以去跟fly high媲美
[02:45.36]我伸手就抓过了桌上的汽水
[02:48.21]在湿热的午后 好像被下了诅咒
[02:50.47]我甚至可以闻到自己灵魂里的腐臭
[02:53.17]这好热 我实在爱死这个季节
[02:55.51]暴烈的阳光赤裸的晒出这个世界
[02:58.28]连呼吸都烫口 千万别把冷气放走
[03:00.71]它塞满整个房间走廊散在每个窗口
[03:03.46]我打开冰箱 有西瓜和饮料
[03:05.93]就听着jazz打2k 我欢迎你来领教
[03:08.62]听窗外有鸟叫 蝉鸣 和小孩哭闹
[03:11.20]乘凉下棋的老人这一局又是谁输掉
[03:13.82]b boys b girls还在街上跳舞
[03:16.29]但夏天的结束也悄悄进入倒数
[03:19.47]我才顾不得这天气的炎热
[03:21.50]拥着你亲吻你汗湿的颈脖
[03:24.08]你眼神的闪烁好像星空的斑驳
[03:26.50]你跳跃的脊背是我心跳的忐忑
[03:29.37]这热度加速挥发你的香气
[03:31.76]凉席 留着你形状的汗滴
[03:34.37]你毛孔微张 浅浅深深的呼吸
[03:37.05]吱呀的电扇回应着我们的轻声密语
[03:39.59]不停息的蝉鸣 跃跃欲试的情绪
[03:41.91]而我一直心急 害怕片刻的分离
[03:44.76]I wish my summer could last forever
[03:47.24]get sweaty already we ran wild n wilder
[03:49.78]整个夏日我一直在挥霍 发烫的眼神点燃荷尔蒙和不安的动作
[03:54.87]阳光刺眼的片刻 美丽就快饱和
[03:57.35]你给的快乐是我深陷的沼泽
[03:59.74]但如果你走了 我的夏天就变晦涩
[04:02.67]我收集六七八月却永远等不来收获
[04:05.28]maybe一夜长大是我唯一的选择
[04:07.98]但我还妄想 守望夏天的那个我会复活
[04:11.50]But the summer’s gone
[04:12.76]My songs are not done
[04:13.93]The wind blowing will never tell me where did I go wrong

[00:24.72]现在你在哪
[00:26.08]虽然存着你的电话
[00:27.60]但不会再打
[00:28.80]我不知道该用什么口气 用哪句开场白
[00:31.79]该说些什么狗屁 当不该再往来
[00:34.75]但baby so sorry 我最近常失控
[00:37.33]像用力踩下油门前方是个无底之洞
[00:40.06]当我在夜里发疯 在梦里喊你名字
[00:42.84]从来没有回应 你在哪
[00:45.87]我试着找寻你的踪迹 弥补那过错
[00:48.54]失败后自抛自弃 反而变得堕落
[00:51.46]沉寂于酒池肉林像是扑火的飞蛾
[00:54.24]却再也无法面对自己 我躲进龟壳
[00:57.12]如果这是个惩罚 上帝他要我记住
[00:59.88]先转身离开的人活该被踢到屁股
[01:02.92]我接受这礼物 但我们还差几步
[01:05.69]就可以走到老去走到生命的底部
[01:08.78]baby i can not let it go

[01:36.78]可在喝醉的夜里 惊醒的梦里
[01:39.82]却又看见了你
[01:42.73]如果分开是注定 那为何还要遇到
[01:45.45]上帝的安排难道只为留下一个记号
[01:48.38]我想 你是他给我的天使
[01:51.16]但我除了爱只从你身上学会偏执
[01:54.15]别说我念念不忘 不是揪着过去不放
[01:56.92]我只是迷路忘了出口暂时让我独唱
[01:59.73]在这迷雾的森林 我这种人也有真情
[02:02.52]甚至怀疑那是幻觉 是我在无病呻吟
[02:05.44]你把那段青春给我 而我还给你遗憾
[02:08.21]结果是我活在遗憾之中并慢慢习惯
[02:11.10]回忆只会留下空白 并没有留下线索
[02:13.82]有些人不是离开 更像从没出现过
[02:16.79]在分开之后我有听说很多你的八卦
[02:19.51]不管你去了厦门东京台北还是拉萨
[02:22.44]都一样 我想你已经找到了好男人
[02:25.26]而我还是lonely 只有一堆脑残粉
[02:28.60]baby i can not let it go

[00:49.98]伸手摸了口袋里所剩無幾的盤纏
[00:52.59]有時他覺得生活真的很好玩
[00:54.79]有時感歎生存都好難
[00:56.69]他對這個世界陌生又期盼
[00:58.95]對自己發問是他最近的習慣

[01:04.39]爲什麽工作只看簡歷不看實力
[01:06.98]他問爲什麽曾經他的眼神是執意
[01:09.53]現在做每個決定都會略帶遲疑

[02:05.16]告訴自己這些年的辛苦沒白費
[02:07.92]要捍衛 你的夢想別對自己慚愧

夜车
[by:JaneLHR]
[00:33.40]耳边还嗡嗡响
[00:36.04]他们都对我讲
[00:38.49]我是夜里的光
[00:41.06]但我感觉很脏
[00:43.66]夜晚的避风港
[00:46.27]外面的风太凉
[00:48.85]告诉你夜有多晃
[00:51.49]告诉你心有多荒凉
[00:54.12]她是夜场的Dancer 总是穿的很SHINEs
[00:56.20]他开夜班的的士 开得好快
[00:58.84]每天都准时 在苏荷的门口
[01:01.48]男人抱着头，靠着门，等着她出来
[01:04.08]她说身不由己 其实讨厌喝酒
[01:06.60]只是为了应酬 没完没了的应酬
[01:09.35]她说着说着也就没声了
[01:11.90]其实不用看也知道她睡着了
[01:14.45]月光洒在飞驰的出租车上
[01:17.03]一路前往 男人一路在欣赏
[01:19.57]有点潮红的是，那张熟睡的脸
[01:22.33]是种幸福的事，后视镜的画面
[01:24.93]她会喃喃自语，那他就轻轻地听
[01:27.61]其实都是乱说，他却字字入心
[01:30.14]如果这条路能够一直没有尽头
[01:32.77]每天的剧终 到了她的家门口
[01:35.71]耳边还嗡嗡响
[01:38.52]他们都对我讲
[01:41.16]我是夜里的光
[01:43.83]但我感觉很脏
[01:46.19]夜晚的避风港
[01:48.94]外面的风太凉
[01:51.44]告诉你夜有多晃
[01:54.38]告诉你心有多荒凉
[01:56.80]每晚准时的等候 在苏荷门口
[01:59.13]红着脸的她 温柔诉说她的梦
[02:01.56]有时 安静的 互相望着不开口
[02:04.23]有时 轻声的 微笑 点头或摇头
[02:06.81]没有情人节的许诺 没有海誓山盟
[02:09.31]脑子里面回忆许多 下车会牵她手
[02:11.91]当每天的准点已经成为了习惯
[02:14.64]他只想守候夜晚快点到来
[02:17.02]诉说她的心事 收到的礼物多么精致
[02:19.74]又喝多了几次 慢慢融化他的心
[02:22.37]在耳边的轻语 撩拨的发丝
[02:25.15]红唇轻咬 挑拨他的心思
[02:27.86]偶尔回头 对望 眼神的交汇
[02:30.33]有时闭眼 微醉 怕她越来越憔悴
[02:33.21]慢慢的 变得无话不谈
[02:35.72]好像一对情侣 相会夜车彼岸
[02:38.48]耳边还嗡嗡响
[02:40.98]他们都对我讲
[02:43.61]我是夜里的光
[02:46.24]但我感觉很脏
[02:48.83]夜晚的避风港
[02:51.45]外面的风太凉
[02:54.10]告诉你夜有多晃
[02:56.69]告诉你心有多荒凉
[02:59.16]Maybe没有要求结果才不会失落
[03:01.49]但是处在暧昧里的他好像是着了魔
[03:04.06]开始有了憧憬他像是有了寄托
[03:06.78]但是美梦还没开始就被无情打破
[03:09.51]那晚下班 她身边有个伴
[03:11.95]是个老板 他脸比轮胎宽
[03:14.67]他通过后视镜只看见那个男人的背
[03:17.30]而今天不是载她回家是去酒店睡
[03:20.06]那晚是极其漫长夜未央
[03:22.31]要送她的花还躺在后备箱
[03:24.84]鼓起勇气的话还没有来得及讲
[03:27.54]算了 现在也只能这样
[03:29.86]第二天她下班没有看见她的专车
[03:33.01]其实她似乎也好像察觉到了什么
[03:35.92]转身要走 看见了熟悉的车灯
[03:38.31]隔着玻璃她没法忘记那个眼神
[03:41.19]

[01:46.80]The reason my power's here on earth
[01:48.66]Salute the truth, when the prophet say
[01:50.53]
[01:50.73]I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
[01:51.45]This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years

[02:07.07]
[02:07.62]Tell me somethin'
[02:08.13]You *********as can't tell me nothin'
[02:09.28]I'd rather die than to listen to you
[02:11.03]My DNA not for imitation
[02:12.85]Your DNA an abomination
[02:14.75]This how it is when you're in the Matrix
[02:16.65]Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
[02:18.39]And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
[02:19.79]And sleepin' in a villa
[02:21.58]Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
[02:22.94]Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
[02:24.28]Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
[02:26.05]Baby in the pool, godfather goals
[02:27.82]Only Lord knows, I've been goin' ham
[02:29.91]I'm dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
[02:31.51]Eat at 4 Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
[02:33.48]Yoga on a Monday, stretchin to Nirvana
[02:35.63]Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
[02:37.28]Phone never on, I don't conversate
[02:38.98]I don't compromise, I just penetrate
[02:40.80]Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
[02:42.74]These are the times, level number 9
[02:44.41]Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
[02:46.27]Sentence on the way, killings on the way

[00:36.45]Can I move your feet make your heart skip a beat
[00:40.09]can a simple tune flow through you
[00:43.54]也许是上天注定我所要做的事情
[00:47.35]总是在夜里 思念漂浮不清充斥神经
[00:50.88]我也会幻想也有太多话要去讲
[00:54.20]心思却带着行动出逃 找不到解药
[00:58.40]想到你没法挽留 席卷回忆全部带走
[01:02.03]最后放开的是你那双温暖的手
[01:05.78]每天都想你 湿润了瞳孔
[01:09.48]不能够怪我 怪我太懵懂
[01:13.24]Can u think about me sometimes without u
[01:17.34]Why I love u so much that’s all true

[01:57.40]或者是承诺事情太多说出来的太早
[02:01.07]勇敢把束缚冲破可能因为我们年少
[02:04.87]努力过就好 尽力了就好
[02:07.73]我劝自己放弃说过一次就好都过的舒服就好
[02:12.32]我从没想过关系变成这样越发复杂
[02:15.96]回忆像散落一地无从收拾碎发胡渣
[02:19.69]那你还好吗 我走以后还好吗
[02:22.84]I regret after breaking up
[02:25.18]I regret after breaking up
[02:27.45]算了算了 散了散了 断了断了

[00:00.00]❤❤❤
[00:13.26]我想看著妳的眼睛心跳加速频率
[00:15.91]在晚上聽海水的声音 假装思绪平静
[00:18.75]妳的聲線像是藏了蜂蜜
[00:20.86]听一次就上瘾 心思不懟他人泄密
[00:24.13]我凭默契 答出满分考卷
[00:27.33]想聽著妳的呼吸入眠
[00:29.52]有妳的夢 就用心記念
[00:31.05]我說我最討厭告別
[00:32.69]讨厌通话挂断 妳說再見的瞬間
[00:36.24]那些电流变成妳的聲線
[00:38.89]像妳睡在我的左手边
[00:41.69]可每次醒来睁眼
[00:43.43]這房間還是空空如也
[00:46.77]妳遊戲打得太娴熟 我開局就要認輸
[00:51.46]妳气笑了 又像是要哭
[00:53.64]是我傻嗎 還是糊塗
[00:55.34]也許是二者兼顧
[00:58.17]妳的昵称有點奇怪
[01:01.01]朋友圈三天可见
[01:02.19]却从不发动态 让人意外
[01:04.86]我钓鱼执法 也许妳在消息列表出现
[01:08.36]夢到你的点赞提示 我笑醒在凌晨三点
[01:11.54]妳的坏习惯我突然都学会
[01:14.05]接到你的來電 我忍著困意不睡
[01:16.93]我对你漂亮妥協 像三分熟七分醉
[01:20.02]怪你十分迷人 却不能做个满分情人 it’s too late
[01:33.74]我想宠著你 却摸不透你的脾氣
[01:37.00]阴晴不定 像是一阵飓风過境
[01:39.94]我没那么喜欢游戏 上線只是想陪你
[01:42.97]忘記說 妳早巳經闯进我的安全区里
[01:45.91]你低头问我 為什麽臉上有個問號
[01:49.36]我好疑惑 怎么你让我神魂颠倒 无可救藥
[01:53.22]一见钟情好俗套
[01:55.43]可砸中我的那一刻 卻有点美妙
[02:08.25]我的味道上是妳的衣領
[02:11.46]妳的左心房有我的壹坪
[02:14.48]想被妳鎖緊 在南山塔
[02:17.42]有月亮的山顶
[02:19.16]我不能怪你 就这样突然断了聯系
[02:23.47]脱离保质期 只是很想再把这段感情继续
[02:27.38]偷偷想妳 却不敢问在干嘛的话题
[02:31.50]如果我喜欢你 如果你对我有点在意
[02:37.31]如果我喜欢你 如果你从不对我在意
[02:43.18]如果我喜欢你
[02:45.74]

[00:12.51]又是一年一度 的情人节
[00:15.38]我还是一个人坐在街角的咖啡店里
[00:18.54]看着来往的情人甜言蜜语
[00:21.53]咬着耳朵说你sexy
[00:23.13]让他感觉到很horny
[00:24.59]今天晚上想要拥有你
[00:27.37]脑海里全部都是Melody
[00:30.39]甚至发誓一直会走下去
[00:33.51]女孩你真的傻的够可以
[00:36.51]耳机的音量调到最大
[00:38.45]来猜测隔壁的对话
[00:39.75]马路对面又开始打架
[00:41.16]好奇会不会有雨下
[00:42.65]听说桥上在查酒驾
[00:44.15]前男友应该早就醉死在牡丹的花下
[00:47.80]屏幕在播放着伦敦的天气预报
[00:50.62]Cappuccino香醇的味道
[00:52.20]莫名上扬的嘴角却在微笑
[00:54.41]小鹿一般的心跳
[00:55.97]慢慢在我的心底发酵
[00:57.45]Oh my sweety honey
[00:58.90]I gotta make it slow down
[01:00.47]我想要吻你
[01:01.56]想要拥抱你
[01:02.81]不想要轻声细语述说你我的小秘密
[01:05.83]就算得不到也没关系
[01:07.26]一个吻就可以
[01:08.82]情人节不用在一起
[01:10.44]我也没问题
[01:11.82]我需要见你看一眼就足已
[01:14.03]You are my one and only
[01:15.54]千万别叫我baby
[01:17.03]一个吻就可以
[01:18.46]我不需要你给我天长地久的回忆
[01:21.05]Wanna get to me by now
[01:22.14]熟悉到我更反感的味道
[01:24.54]或许更偏爱烟雾缭绕
[01:26.37]像病毒一般的瘟疫 循环到我上瘾
[01:29.85]I keep on trying to know you
[01:31.72]But i never really had my chance to
[01:33.58]Young forever till the day i die
[01:35.80]不管你爱不爱
[01:36.99]反正我就是这么怪
[01:39.48]Suckers born in every day and night
[01:41.85]给自己多一点尊重
[01:43.13]绝对不能心动
[01:44.60]失去了就不会心痛
[01:48.53]Just One Night In ChongQing
[01:50.77]发誓明天过后我就会把你忘得更彻底
[01:53.96]Ah yeay
[01:55.99]我不过说说而已

[00:04.00]封面 : 班长
[00:24.42]据说真的有神
[00:25.27]是一个孤家寡人
[00:26.57]可从未见过那扇门
[00:27.87]是我太孤陋寡闻
[00:29.37]就坐井观天
[00:30.37]一个小房间
[00:31.82]然后对这凡间指指点点
[00:34.26]迫切需要一个主动的聆听者
[00:37.10]而并非经营者
[00:39.01]又或是新时代的失语者
[00:40.20]要保持清醒着
[00:41.44]不再被囚禁着蹂躏着灌输着认知只想要做个孤云野鹤
[00:45.21]经受挑战
[00:46.80]反对的意见就如同迎面飞来的子弹
[00:49.40]眼看 腐烂
[00:50.85]我捏了一把冷汗
[00:52.14]察觉被时间追逐的紧迫感
[00:53.85]问自己如何才能走到彼岸
[00:55.66]在问题中禁锢
[00:57.81]把道理都记住
[00:59.20]为了挣脱牢笼困住使尽了浑身解数
[01:01.45]一个事实的陈述
[01:02.89]即使要走一万步
[01:04.30]看前方困难险阻全都视若无物
[01:06.60]看过什么书
[01:07.79]走过哪条路
[01:10.52]拨不开的雾
[01:11.16]发不出的怒
[01:12.01]是光鲜谢幕
[01:13.50]或万劫不复
[01:14.90]要多深刻的领悟
[01:16.15]才学会了说“不”
[01:17.44]在黑暗里导演的戏能不能看清
[01:24.17]一意孤行
[01:24.81]孤掌难鸣
[01:25.71]长长的望远镜不是该望向天上的星
[01:28.51]当我们最后向命运低头
[01:31.14]认为自己是环境里牺牲的独角兽
[01:33.44]习惯了听天由命的停住不走
[01:36.58]成为现行潜规则里的落水狗
[01:39.13]it's maybe not gonna make u awake
[01:39.13]（装睡的人可能这辈子也不会醒来）
[01:42.26]but i do think it’s worth the risk
[01:42.26]（可我依然觉得值得一试）
[01:45.11]holp our mind never gonna be break
[01:45.11]（希望我们的意志永远不会因现实而粉碎）
[01:48.09]little baby come on and stay
[01:48.09]（加入我的战队吧小宝贝！）
[02:02.19]吹起一阵风 让人群忧心忡忡
[02:03.69]像是一阵风 它来去无影踪
[02:06.49]吹起一阵风 管你多么的精通
[02:09.02]像是一阵风 捕捉不住的行踪

[00:20.14]之后的每次想到你都偷偷
[00:23.10]说过和你断了联系不再连线
[00:26.27]可是心里还有止不住的执念
[00:28.98]可能也不是还爱着你
[00:31.89]只是对这段感情的惋惜
[00:35.09]不想我的身上还残留你任何气息
[00:37.94]不想聚会朋友都问你最近的消息
[00:40.91]不想和你再有关联不为你而叹息

[01:36.46]像梭哈了筹码 却没有高超手法
[01:39.57]怎么可能再赢回来 心你也进不来
[01:42.68]分开后每一首情歌我们都听不来
[01:46.90]再一次踏上旅途 带着些许的企图
[01:49.71]不再让心情起伏
[01:51.26]不再亮出了心
[01:53.97]我们同时转身离开又一次再放逐了心 my babe

[00:03.22]后期：Matt
[00:03.87]心妹：深度（嗯）,有没有那么一天像这样再拿起麦克风的时候
[00:12.55]依然还是像这样一腔热血呢？
[00:15.96]shenduzzhp：我在想,我很怕有一天站在台上拿起麦克风的时候
[00:21.20]唱的已经是不是我想唱的东西了
[00:22.42]心妹：
[00:23.19]你没有哭 又拿起了麦克
[00:25.64]喜欢当观众的时候 可惜你不在这
[00:28.18]你心里很奇怪的别人唱片都在卖着
[00:30.80]曾拥有一个梦但是 心早已不在这
[00:33.50]是否忘了自己说的话都不可信
[00:36.18]太过逞强 不想就这样认了命
[00:38.77]又太较真 却总想要得到别人肯定
[00:41.50]也希望这样一首歌 也许会有人听
[00:44.27]或许不在乎所有 难过时喝杯酒
[00:46.82]有天观众在台下看你演出结束会有多久
[00:49.44]有没有 最开心的一刻是在这
[00:52.06]太认真 是因为从开始到最后还爱着
[00:54.88]某天 听别人谈起你的故事
[00:57.49]坚持自己的想法依然有些固执
[01:00.10]还是在这所城市 不像从前混天度日
[01:02.78]在高楼顶层 坐在天台向下注视
[01:05.32]二直：
[01:05.62]风雨再大也不能阻挡
[01:10.33]音乐是不可磨灭的梦想
[01:16.60]不知道这条路还有多长只希望
[01:22.00]你会记住我的模样
[01:25.97]shenduzzhp：
[01:26.58]初三那年同学录上写下我最大的梦想
[01:29.16]如今也自嘲能实现的几率仿佛就像是中奖
[01:31.81]可能还是太贪心 面对家人不断的关心
[01:34.41]内心反复挣扎 是遇到水爆炸的干冰
[01:37.09]打消了执念 在现实里实现 不想再远走他乡
[01:39.69]老爸还在抱怨 我只能抱歉 快把他的钱花光
[01:42.40]不熟悉 又急于独立 才会放弃了空乘
[01:45.01]我变成一个好小孩 成了大家眼中的公认
[01:47.73]还想做个心比天大的顽童 像 盘龙 不会蛮怂
[01:51.09]能够从容应对冷嘲热讽
[01:52.95]带着我的足迹 即使他们不服气
[01:55.58]即使最后撞的头破血流输的一败涂地
[01:58.20]我在 我怪 我fly
[02:00.31]炽烈的心在作怪 阻挡不了阻挡不了 因为我爱
[02:03.42]这条路举步维艰但是我不能够停滞
[02:06.18]也希望看到你在挥手当听到我的名字
[02:08.55]二直：
[02:08.83]风雨再大也不能阻挡

[00:24.34]怎么怎么做呢
[00:25.57]怎么怎么才能让你相信呢
[00:28.84]明知是没结果却绝不回头个性
[00:34.16]我要怎么怎么说呢
[00:35.39]怎么怎么做呢
[00:36.79]怎么怎么才能让你放弃呢
[00:39.55]放弃说服我变成你 变的不在意
[00:45.73]强加的概念只让人想反手给你个扳手
[00:48.06]是不是忘了检修脑内自带的虚拟端口
[00:51.10]难不成想重新把头部挤进盆骨的开口
[00:54.01]这种话又叫我怎么说的出口
[00:57.24]不是我太小气 也不是在赌气
[00:58.98]但我真的比你更了解自己
[01:02.05]这是我的 我决定的
[01:05.60]我想要的 很适合

[01:16.23]我想我可以就这样过一辈子
[01:20.08]并不是非要邀请别人一起
[01:27.74]不是逞强而已
[01:30.77]应该遵循的原则有的理想皈依的宗教
[01:33.30]应该怎样可能怎样这些都不重要
[01:38.29]不同的理念是否就必须要彼此咆哮
[01:39.05]躲避喧闹的洁身自好是在为自己熬药
[01:42.72]文字不是事物 不想受道理约束
[01:44.59]深刻的爱本身不存在于街角的窗户
[01:47.10]哪条真理可以对抗所有的怀疑迂腐
[01:50.52]自由或许就是无迹可寻的国度
[01:52.77]下不停的大雨
[01:56.78]泛起思绪
[02:00.66]想哪里是真的想去
[02:04.51]爱的自由 想的放纵
[02:07.01]念头能否 静止不动
[02:10.25]别想掌控 不会放松
[02:13.02]为每一刻 不被怂恿
[02:16.17]生活的每一种 不会是同一种
[02:18.50]开花结果不过是另一种比较没不同
[02:21.39]是我是很执着 执着于认真过
[02:24.28]过好每天回头看时觉得没不妥
[02:29.33]所谓评价 分析 判断的头脑激荡
[02:31.05]利益分配 是否 均衡的期货市场
[02:32.80]矛盾逐渐放大对抗也在日渐滋长
[02:34.87]不想把生活浪费在恐惧之上
[02:38.42]一步步将理想中的乌托邦围剿捕获
[02:40.72]摆脱乱花渐欲迷人眼的蛊惑
[02:44.68]抑制我垂死病中惊坐起举刀的仵作
[02:46.96]一举全歼 遗址就是我的主卧
[02:49.28]我要怎么怎么说呢
[03:00.91]怎么怎么做呢

[00:30.850]想记录每个瞬间
[00:32.310]又不敢偷偷拍照片
[00:34.180]你总是对我闪躲
[00:35.790]让我被不安包裹
[00:37.180]面对你你也知道我经常的唯唯诺诺
[00:39.970]喜欢你不说 活该我落寞
[00:42.880]难道成全你 放手才算是真的让你解脱
[00:46.650]我明明不想那么做

[00:52.260]我走了也要照顾身体
[00:54.290]别的女生一定没我那么喜欢你
[00:57.940]不会再追随你的目光
[01:00.800]对喜欢的人一定好好讲
[01:03.590]看你的眼神不再发亮

[01:08.040]明明是对视的眼睛
[01:09.370]为什么却像只像交错而已
[01:11.180]讶异的微表情 达不到你心境
[01:14.310]你认真的看完谢幕后我的独角戏
[01:17.230]没关系没关系 我也只是过路而已

[01:42.780]和你相处就觉得很满足
[01:45.020]你的喜好都在我记忆里背的滚瓜烂熟
[01:48.020]但是 突然我成了你的牢笼
[01:50.530]再没有你的笑容 心被抛上了高空
[01:55.030]全都是我的冲动 挥霍了你的纵容
[01:58.710]但不能从头
[02:00.810]是我错过了末班车
[02:02.440]没关系不用担心我你才是受害者
[02:06.610]偶尔翻阅我们的纪念册
[02:08.620]就当是路过 也错过了你的独特
[02:12.170]不会再追随你的目光
[02:15.110]从前的笑容早就泛黄

[00:18.000]我喜欢看着你认真注视着她的双眼
[00:20.940]有时很热情 但大多时候都很腼腆
[00:23.950]有时仿佛所有力气都凝聚在指尖
[00:26.900]只要被多看一眼就立马假装在看天
[00:29.780]其实你的她也没有那么优秀
[00:32.960]至少她学不来我擅长的说学唱逗
[00:36.140]我仔细想了一下你也没有必要将就
[00:38.960]别因为太寂寞了就把感情胡拼乱凑
[00:41.810]其实你们的共同朋友都觉得你们不太合适
[00:48.850]我倒是想要做的进退有度可我根本没法控制
[00:52.360]我听了你说的话可我根本没法消气
[00:57.650]她为什么总对你指手画脚怎么不腻
[01:00.770]我觉得你们在一起根本就没有意义
[01:03.460]不如也稍微分开一点看看我的魅力
[01:06.490]我脑子一片空白可才刚刚见到你
[01:09.250]我根本没有办法再遇到像你的事情
[01:11.920]oh baby 让我和你 就我们一起
[01:15.080]难道你还要告诉我你有隐藏着别的秘密
[01:18.670]我从来都没想过 会有这样的生活
[01:22.040]你的想法也不错 干脆我们就一起过
[01:25.520]oh baby 难道还没发现吗
[01:28.560]遇见你的时候阳光都暗啦
[01:34.180]你看看你坐在我的对面又在喝闷酒
[01:37.270]我看着你失恋的样子实在有点糗
[01:39.970]所以什么时候才要拉我手
[01:42.840]我说不出来这种难以言喻的激动
[01:46.050]就赶快牵起我的手我的心就当附赠
[01:49.400]让我打开你的心门再闯进你的空城
[01:52.230]是魔王就得下一百层
[01:54.290]是时候展现我的真诚 我该说些什么才能
[01:57.840]调解下现场气氛 你开始发愣
[02:00.370]别假装不懂我的心思我早就看透彻了
[02:03.530]别再说不了 你根本早是我的

[00:13.99]一旦打开手机就能看见你的微信
[00:17.42]失去分寸的你放弃以退为进
[00:19.98]不会丢下你所以别再乱下达指令
[00:22.96]有时候希望你也好好照顾自己
[00:25.32]很想拥抱你
[00:26.94]很想靠近你
[00:28.32]可是你也反省一下自己行不行
[00:31.12]真的爱我也请花点心思费点脑筋
[00:33.87]总说我琢磨不定 是你情商太低
[00:37.11]AY 打开电视机你在身边为什么不满意
[00:40.48]没办法理解你的情绪行为太诡异
[00:43.35]每次周末party你都放弃
[00:45.91]只在家打游戏 我都没跟你怄气
[00:48.84]每天都只看着我的眼神太过专注
[00:52.09]可先生拜托仔细看你现在在过马路
[00:54.77]虽然很喜欢你对我的呵护
[00:57.21]那也得注意温度 太高了容易超速
[01:00.23]你从来不会为了自己的事情多烦恼
[01:03.29]但是遇到我的trouble你都不拖延一秒
[01:06.34]我也不是觉得有多么想吵
[01:08.89]可你担心的太早 我真的有点想跑
[01:11.90]再说一次我的真心都想掏给你看
[01:15.08]真的别太敏感 让我们每次冷战
[01:17.89]还说我让你气得吃不下饭

[01:41.18]知道你是为了我
[01:42.43]可真的负担太多
[01:43.99]就这样 就这样稍微留点空间好吗
[01:46.87]现在你也看看我的眼睛
[01:49.18]难道还有些话没挑明 对待你绝对真心
[01:52.17]这就是我对着你的loyalty 你一个人的权利别的我都帮你搞定
[01:57.91]在上一首就唱过这不是什么秘密
[02:00.60]好多情话也都放在歌里 只要你用心去听
[02:04.09]你做的傻事太多还全部说是为了我
[02:06.78]可这招我爸妈在我八岁时早就用过
[02:10.02]不想太过沉默 是真的没有话说
[02:12.76]你说你没做错我也承认是负担太多
[02:15.50]难道还要我写信特地歌颂
[02:18.01]你太任性的冲动 或者小聪明乱用
[02:21.25]我放着歌巴不得你能听着入梦
[02:24.11]可你真的都完全不懂 还嫌我不够稳重
[02:27.17]所以我早就说过两个人得互相迁就
[02:30.17]我熬的夜都熟了你还对我说666
[02:33.17]很想拥抱你
[02:34.15]很想靠近你

[00:19.36]有天我睡醒看到我的身边没有你
[00:23.38]在我的右边是你曾经喜欢的玩具
[00:27.64]可当我站起身来在房间里寻找你
[00:31.94]留下的只有带着你味道的一封信
[00:36.42]就在昨天还一起看我们的照片
[00:40.50]可现在让我感觉像烂剧里的主演
[00:44.60]为什么这种事情会发生在我身边
[00:48.87]是不是老天没能看到对你的疯癫
[00:53.09]还想着创造你的宇宙
[00:56.34]但现在已经被我清空
[00:58.43]你让我整个人都冰冻
[01:00.57]还怎么再次为你心动
[01:02.67]Wake me 不是你的意愿
[01:04.82]离开我开始新的起点
[01:06.86]可能我还会对你贪恋
[01:09.02]谁让你曾经让我疯癫
[01:11.17]疯癫那也是过去的画面
[01:14.64]看往后的几天
[01:16.26]我猜你也不会出现
[01:18.79]我回想这几年
[01:20.66]就像是要命的病变
[01:23.06]你可能听不见
[01:24.67]来自我对你的挂念
[01:27.36]可能有点累觉得对不对
[01:30.10]这是第几次在为你宿醉
[01:32.07]没了我肩膀你在谁身旁
[01:34.14]买的礼物变成了灰
[01:35.96]曾经我多想把你变漂亮
[01:38.38]看着别人羡慕你的模样
[01:40.36]没关系有小熊陪着我看月亮
[01:44.21]我已经看到跟你断电的过程
[01:46.68]但是我假装看不见
[01:48.54]是不是要我变得像个厉鬼
[01:50.80]才能进入你的世界
[01:52.76]为什么不说再见
[01:54.40]我猜你应该是不小心的忘记
[01:56.88]都无所谓也有点累
[01:58.99]也可以开始新的记忆
[02:01.25]有天我睡醒看到我的身边没有你

[02:35.14]我不能够停止啊
[02:37.14]这些年我对你的疯癫
[02:39.50]戴上那条围巾吗
[02:41.23]在每个寒风刺骨的冬天
[02:43.89]每次送你回家你抱着我
[02:45.56]不经意间又触碰到你的手
[02:47.80]你穿裙子眨眼睛望着我
[02:50.43]让我每次心动的瞬间
[02:52.46]那条十字路口
[02:54.17]始终有你身上的气味
[02:57.13]车水马龙过后的
[02:58.46]路灯下的身影又会是谁
[03:01.20]我想说我真的喜欢你
[03:03.47]但每次欲言又闭嘴
[03:05.22]那时荒唐的男孩又浑浊了几岁
[03:09.40]有天我睡醒看到我的身边没有你
[03:13.26]在我的右边是你曾经喜欢的玩具
[03:17.53]可当我站起身来在房间里寻找你

[00:26.38]这是一个有着香气的晚上
[00:28.22]又忘了给自己准备晚饭
[00:30.39]电话里和朋友打个嘴仗
[00:32.20]因为常见面感情不咸不淡
[00:34.51]约个时间还是在老地方
[00:36.74]最近比较忙没有空闲会餐
[00:38.89]浅色的衣服显得相对健康
[00:40.98]平和的心情拿来搭配便装
[00:43.31]eh~ 色彩斑斓的世界~
[00:47.62]eh~不想独自去冒险~

[01:00.74]Holy crap 天气好的意外
[01:02.27]打个包所有的不愉快全外带拖到街角的垃圾桶
[01:05.87]让它们去相拥
[01:07.20]懒惰像麦粒肿越敷衍越集拢
[01:09.06]怎么能把难过消极的想法
[01:10.91]你走到哪就带着他们到了哪
[01:13.36]由如黄金般闪烁的快乐
[01:15.28]全新的街区 是的 它们就在这
[01:17.75]别再想所谓事情的经过
[01:19.45]而我在讲所谓过程的困惑
[01:21.56]也都只不过是三秒之前的落寞
[01:23.63]来把酒杯都举起then we drinking and drinking
[01:25.93]再来多加一点烟雾和节奏
[01:27.86]多巴胺的成分再多都不够
[01:29.98]灯光也很重要DJ控制心跳
[01:32.11]直到你料到音乐就是解药

[02:04.54]Drinking dancing drinking dancing drinking dancing~
[02:08.91]不要老是坐在隔壁摁手机
[02:11.00]你想要轻松要让自己先忘记
[02:12.94]唯有开心的事才是有意义
[02:14.92]管它任何琐碎都能选择性的失忆
[02:17.37]我在为美好寻找防腐剂
[02:19.22]所以我想问你能否与我一起
[02:21.46]现状是格格巫打不到他他不现形
[02:23.82]那请教蓝精灵设个陷阱让它透明
[02:25.94]把音乐调到最大 turn it up~
[02:28.04]拥有的气氛最佳 drink it al~
[02:30.08]跳到没有知觉整晚没有睡眠
[02:32.09]视野被侵略思维受到牵连
[02:34.27]来把身心上交到这一秒
[02:36.29]放大你的自我像只无拘的鸟
[02:38.58]忧愁是几张陈设的便条
[02:40.77]翻到后面一页画你中意的线条
[02:43.43]One two three and four
[02:45.00]Let's go to the party and we never fall

[00:43.290]挂在床边和你一起拍的拍立得
[00:45.740]每次都想先开始话题可该说什么

[00:11.900]不管我的心多想靠近
[00:14.750]是距离 距离感压抑
[00:23.170]想和你分享我钻研的课题
[00:29.050]路边的花开好了围绕蜻蜓
[00:35.150]想和你共享我身边的空气
[00:38.970]没有你
[00:45.770]因为你总是在很远的地方
[00:47.720]找你的时候 也会担心你太忙
[00:50.920]你在的话 应该能有特别的想法
[00:53.410]你是指引着我的 我的灯塔
[00:58.290]你的理由是梦想
[01:01.300]我的理由是你呀
[01:07.640]我还没来得及和你一起去看极光
[01:10.540]看看那里到底有多值我们欣赏
[01:13.480]一起看这世上最美好的风光
[01:16.030]好吗 好吗

[01:33.530]不同的个体只要能陪着我就好了
[01:36.430]想你的时间有点久
[01:37.970]没法和你并肩走
[01:39.370]你身边大概也会有未来的某某
[01:42.260]只是你离我好像有点远
[01:45.010]如果真的太想你还能揉揉眼
[01:49.760]那你能不能脚步慢点
[01:53.460]我没说完的话你还想听吗
[01:59.250]哪怕你在 很远的地方
[02:05.380]我想这一切都是距离感吧
[02:09.630]是吧
[02:15.960]我也不知道什么时候开始
[02:19.010]我们之间的距离隔了无数英尺
[02:21.690]无数次我想要不那么呆滞
[02:23.690]却发现我弄丢了你的影子 总会错你的意思
[02:27.300]曾以为没了你生活就不行
[02:30.100]才发现原来我给自己画了好大的饼
[02:32.940]能去更好的地方就快些走吧
[02:35.380]脚步也别特地那么慢啦
[03:00.490]我还没来得及和你一起去看极光
[03:03.160]看看那里到底有多值我们欣赏
[03:06.000]一起看这世上最美好的风光
[03:08.890]好吗 好吗

[00:21.192]恍如走进一个电影画面
[00:23.096]这昏暗街角在黎明到来前即将幻灭
[00:25.809]残旧砖瓦 斑驳如老旧胶片映着谁的魅影重现
[00:29.558]剧情的走向迷离让人逐渐忘了时间
[00:32.547]人来人往之间或许藏着危险
[00:34.933]路边依依不舍的情侣眼神依然缱绻
[00:37.761]而昨天 错过了一场风花雪月
[00:39.940]多少的诗情画意来到今天早已翻篇
[00:43.432]谁与谁的对视之间带着颜色
[00:45.718]亦或是有人逛了太久突然有点口渴
[00:48.546]停下吧 在转角酒吧来杯玛格丽特
[00:51.607]这夜晚伴有星宿残晖哪能吝啬
[00:53.714]微醺的气氛把你围绕
[00:55.822]你们聊得忘我上个话题还没回到
[00:58.418]推杯换盏酒精漫延麻痹整条街道
[01:01.122]而行人步伐渐缓落幅陷入夜的泥沼
[01:05.354]女孩不熟练地踩着高跟鞋
[01:07.214]买不起橱窗里的裙子又多看几眼
[01:10.088]穿着褶皱西装他手里攥着名片
[01:12.746]优胜劣汰他渴望像宝石被人提炼
[01:15.507]或许你刚来到这个城市
[01:17.500]或许你还没摸清楚这城市的层次
[01:21.032]然后你困惑着 质疑自己或者感到迷失
[01:23.916]这现实压迫着你不得不去直面生死
[01:27.238]当街头诗人停止吟诗
[01:29.779]小说家再写不出故事
[01:32.093]该固执还是偷偷复制或者变得物质
[01:35.290]抉择困扰在他心中重复数次
[01:37.642]在街角 这渺小的你我他太潦草
[01:40.306]请勿扰 每个人之间隔着一座小岛
[01:43.075]红墙老路酸雨浇淋留下味道
[01:45.734]闭上眼 而你现在也身临这个街道
[01:48.463]<hook>
[01:49.127]故事发生在这街角
[01:50.872]总有人在这里站起来又跌倒
[01:53.419]你也常犹豫要往前还是歇脚
[01:56.165]把掉落的信念擦了擦又贴好
[01:59.023]这是你每天都看得到的街角
[02:01.841]总有人在这里站起来又跌倒
[02:04.590]你也常犹豫要往前还是歇脚
[02:06.937]把掉落的信念擦了擦又贴好
[02:09.948]<verse2 泥鳅>
[02:10.386]我坐在街角看着疯狂 匆忙的行人
[02:13.237]猜着他的她的它的情人
[02:16.061]我揣测着每一个有趣的灵魂
[02:18.527]记录着每段故事开始和停顿
[02:21.433]戴礼帽的绅士在礼貌的询问
[02:24.032]衣着是否得体而比例是否匀称
[02:26.855]人模狗样 在那装着情圣
[02:29.378]当夜晚降临成为aka街头淫棍
[02:32.282]卖花的小女孩看起来家境贫困
[02:34.995]拉着大人的衣角介绍花的名称
[02:37.621]我开始思考她能不能过自己的人生
[02:40.294]再勤奋的孩子交上白卷也得零分
[02:43.022]最悠闲的是坐在那辆宝马车的车主
[02:45.792]不像等公交的人奔波为了饭补车补
[02:48.619]背着双肩包的男孩总是想他何苦
[02:51.353]自从长大成人就离开了家的呵护
[02:54.051]这已经是他住在这个城市的第五年
[02:56.745]他已经厌倦了去说生活苦不堪言
[02:59.447]车站旁面容憔悴的妇女还守在摊前
[03:02.072]和她的丈夫一点一滴品尝苦辣酸甜
[03:04.782]大腹便便的中年男子解开了衬衣扣子
[03:07.768]他每天怀念着婚前的妻子笑不露齿
[03:10.591]说不出口 碌碌无为难免失去斗志
[03:13.365]他挽起袖子 摸摸口袋只剩六十
[03:15.949]他可能常说自己的孩子非常幼稚
[03:18.387]每天游手好闲扬言要做说唱斗士
[03:21.104]可他永远无法理解孩子意志多么坚定
[03:23.758]他的梦想发芽成长就如磐石一般坚硬
[03:26.778]各有各的天性 就各安各的天命
[03:29.438]各式各样甜品 得各种各样怜悯
[03:32.121]各图各的前景 就各持各的严谨
[03:34.826]各信各的仙灵 去各等各的天明

[03:42.791]你也常犹豫要往前还是歇脚
[03:45.359]把掉落的信念擦了擦又贴好
[03:48.088]这是你每天都看得到的街角
[03:51.136]总有人在这里站起来又跌倒
[03:53.744]你也常犹豫要往前还是歇脚

[00:46.225]在夜里和记忆中的自己对话
[00:48.670]我想梦境会告诉你别再犹豫
[00:51.519]当你决定踏上直面孤独的长路
[00:54.068]那将意味着尘世平凡任你脱颖而出
[00:56.535]冷落和遗弃 或是没有知己
[00:59.314]希望你能独自承受 也能 不惊宠辱
[01:01.916]外表So What 性别So What
[01:04.536]昨天的错变成今天的收获
[01:06.813]闭眼之后的黑色里没有退路
[01:09.439]那就伴随着气息让意志凝固
[01:12.066]逃避No More 恐惧No More
[01:14.641]把一切交给大脑 我想它会制造幽默

[01:50.878]换一种角度就好了 就看你怎么看
[01:53.457]关上灯 慢慢拉上窗帘
[01:55.829]漂泊的人 住在狭小的房间
[01:58.265]疲惫的心 往往外表很光鲜
[02:01.008]挤着清晨的地铁 站在你旁边
[02:03.602]听着熟悉的歌 认识陌生的人
[02:06.046]有时幸运女神 为你敞开了门
[02:08.636]一次偶然的邂逅 彼此都慌了神
[02:11.269]似曾相识的感觉 或许是缘分
[02:13.860]仿佛来到了盛夏 吃冰镇的西瓜

[02:21.631]谁还陪在你身边 这一路一路
[02:24.299]往往失去后 才懂得它的珍贵
[02:26.641]那些复杂的情绪 该怎么分类
[02:29.273]找回原来的你 跟那一份纯粹
[02:32.185]拿起曾经的笔 当个简单的人类

[00:13.16]拯救了寂寞的你悄然而至无声降临
[00:20.49]离开你 我又 回归了寂寞里
[00:25.85]耳鬓厮磨的表情
[00:27.23]扎眼的触目惊心
[00:28.71]用力攥紧的手臂凸起青筋
[00:32.06]一直在听 好像诵经 循环播放的收音机
[00:35.69]重复灌输我们不适合的原因
[00:38.78]嘈杂纷扰的声音
[00:40.34]像伸出利爪的鹰
[00:41.82]试图剥离刻在骨髓里爱你的基因
[00:45.22]对话也不再温馨
[00:46.72]撕裂开的伤疤终于让自己看清
[00:49.00]是无能为力的占有欲和嫉妒心在作祟
[00:52.32]即使知道你不会
[00:53.84]却还是歇斯底里给你神经质的反馈
[00:57.06]渴望被爱的狼狈
[00:58.67]跳不出的深渊才会
[01:00.22]在爱的面前哗众取宠形同虚设的玩味
[01:05.23]一颗敏感的心已经支离破碎
[01:10.30]面对着你日复一日的乏味
[01:12.33]像对某种信仰沉醉
[01:13.79]虚伪的纯粹
[01:14.99]杀了我的爱还说着自己无罪
[01:16.67]无论我是爱你还是为了取悦我自己

[01:25.47]真是傻得可以
[01:29.38]无论是在过去还是现在的时刻
[01:32.96]都没有 在一起的资格
[01:37.18]谈什么适合不适合
[01:42.82]这道理就是这么简单
[01:44.80]虽然我懂的太晚
[01:46.29]可恋人之间又何如能够去相互比攀
[01:49.11]为了纾解心中不安
[01:50.61]反而不断制造麻烦
[01:52.21]被恐惧束缚的呆板贫乏只显得我如此武断
[01:55.60]爱 被当成手段 在 情绪里搅拌
[01:58.65]像漂浮在海面上仅剩的一块求生木板
[02:01.84]不着边际的等待 不快的实属无奈
[02:05.09]无法冲破的阻碍在烟雾里弥漫开来
[02:10.85]在烟雾里弥漫开来
[02:12.62]怎么给自己个交代
[02:14.09]虚假伪善的片面
[02:16.35]体现在字里行间
[02:17.86]被美好幻想局限
[02:19.48]以为自己聪明到可以去分辨
[02:21.88]真相和谎言
[02:23.22]真心和表演
[02:24.28]盲目的看不见蜜语甜言中暗藏的污点
[02:27.52]没错你说了抱歉
[02:29.00]我却没办法往前
[02:30.70]也曾经一起并肩现在只剩一点可怜
[02:33.60]无论我是爱你还是为了取悦我自己
[02:36.98]都不由自主必须停在这里
[02:42.26]真是傻得可以
[02:46.23]无论是在过去还是现在的时刻
[02:49.81]都没有 在一起的资格

[02:43.110]说着关于未来的感受
[02:46.550]电影情节一样的温柔
[02:50.300]过去被时间偷走
[02:52.890]来不及保留
[02:57.580]读不懂你情绪的宇宙
[03:01.240]明知道不会有以后
[03:05.140]不需要那么讲究
[03:07.780]这次我先走
[03:11.520]If I hold out my arms
[03:18.770]But you never come back

[02:42.07]不需要助理跟经纪人 (提包)
[02:43.77]我带头树起这精气神 (离骚)
[02:45.76]在这用粉丝数审视着患者的诊室里治疗人心闭门
[02:49.15]相互在吹捧的样子很绅士
[02:51.34]歌词本质量真次
[02:52.81]作品都没两首像样的还要在短小的篇幅里夹杂着争执
[02:56.78]十几 执笔
[02:59.02]浸没在池低的实体
[03:00.79]史记 上记录我诗集
[03:02.60]摆上了黄冈的试题
[03:04.20]Now ya know bout me
[03:06.17](That your boy whySf)

《月半小夜曲》（Remix）
作曲 : 彭程锦
作词 : 廖思扬
《月半小夜曲》说唱版

游过车水马龙的路,
我拖着疲倦的身子 
低着脑子玩着微信,
走进蜗居的房子 
一抹墙粉一斤灰尘,
一脚踩出了心事 
妹子走了自然再也用不着哥们的车钥匙
曾经为伊所思 
多做事 少励志 
麻麻木木浑浑噩噩 
攀比着撩妹的本事
你说上班混口饭吃 日子过得没x意思 
一到下班 
一杯杰克丹尼 节奏在放肆
见面对眼 比划下手势 
今晚我我你你谱写着419的故事
其实摇摆回家 照照镜子 
好烦 笑自己像个哈卵 
其实趴在床上发朋友圈缅怀高中的生活 
其实有时活在过去 才会这样过
因为自己不懂事而犯下的过错 
 成了现在相视不能一笑的错过 
舍不得删好友
又丢不下面子去联系 
怕她不次你 还抱有侥幸的心理
 其实你逢场作戏，你浮夸演技
不就是为了顾及她感受放空自己再装个B
 
 念于旧 我望着你过往的背影舍不得走
欢于新 改不了喜新厌旧的毛病 
其实闭上眼睛 我的脑海里都是你的背影
 
为何只剩一弯月，留在我的天空，
这晚以后音讯隔绝。

每个人的人生不会这样永远的过 
每次憧憬虚无来缓和着寂寞
酒精上脑 脑海没有家人的样子 
或许在你心里从来就没有他们的位置
卷半根烟 哼着月半小夜曲 
对生活的透彻又进步了些许 
歌单里从此没有了张震岳的小宇
干完这杯 让我胸怀梦想大声的远去

回眸一笑 
希望你能好 再见青春 
如泣似诉再挑逗
如果哪天 我看见你在微笑 
 半世浮生 不枉这一遭

始于梦魇 止于唇齿 
白天醒来只等晚上磨平掉心事
掩于岁月 露于言表 忘记了人生啊还有梦想要计较
有些女孩 你只会藏在心里 
但是只有一个你会永远埋在心底
岳阳的灯红酒绿不能挽救你 
人生要变得牛X还是只能靠自己
我一直就是一名烂演员 
假装朋友陪伴也只会自我成全
放下该放下的 月亮没有那么圆
你在成全别人的时候也被人成全

穷孩子
[00:00.00] 作曲 : 无
[00:01.00] 作词 : 龍胆紫
[00:03.590]
[00:12.800]一个穷孩子生活
[00:13.990]在有钱人的城市
[00:15.260]他尝试用精神去对抗物质
[00:17.890]但是现实真的太现实
[00:20.170]如果你没有工作
[00:21.320]没有钱就没有饭吃
[00:22.960]我的妈妈告诉我
[00:24.110]生活是艰难的
[00:25.650]我知道这是我
[00:26.690]无法逃避的命运
[00:28.260]所以我憎恨贫穷
[00:29.350]我恨这贫与富的差距
[00:31.040]可为了我的家
[00:32.230]我必须活下去
[00:33.670]我不想让我的孩子
[00:34.910]再经历这一切
[00:36.260]可这个世界似乎
[00:37.280]已经无法再改变
[00:38.860]没有任何人生存不需要钱
[00:41.200]没有钱的时候在我
[00:42.530]心中全都是恶念
[00:44.110]看着这座奢侈淫迷的城市
[00:46.390]包围了这座古老传统的城池
[00:49.180]所有的前提以谋利为基础
[00:51.670]所有的概念为人民币服务
[00:54.380]
[01:15.480]贫穷和富有
[01:16.510]爱恨好与坏
[01:17.880]灵魂真的假的离开或存在
[01:20.560]熟悉城市的孩子开始变得陌生
[01:23.030]思想越来越空
[01:24.340]对别人的事无法集中
[01:26.270]还就剩下他会对你微笑
[01:28.270]接着大声地尖叫用力地拥抱
[01:30.410]
[01:31.130]只相信保佑不需要
[01:32.800]拯救快乐的后面一直
[01:34.770]有着发不完的愁
[01:36.280]就站在你身边的身边
[01:38.160]
[01:38.750]记着开始到结束和中间
[01:40.920]
[01:41.490]他不停的努力鼓起勇气
[01:43.960]没有武器所以相煎何太急
[01:46.110]
[01:46.710]是人心隔肚皮麻痹或逃
[01:49.320]避每个夜里还是他自己
[01:51.810]总梦到去加勒比当 VIP all my
[01:54.710]dawgz
[01:55.250]在这个世界被统一
[01:56.840]
[02:18.040]我看见一个老 b 的车里
[02:19.530]坐着两个妞
[02:20.250]
[02:20.760]还看见他们叼着雪茄可都不抽
[02:23.210]当丑陋的嘴脸藏在金钱背后
[02:25.780]看够了太多无奈所以才嫉恶如仇
[02:28.730]肮脏的车站台
[02:30.140]玩坏的运动器材
[02:31.460]贫穷的孩子路过一直在这待着
[02:33.850]没车没房只有两个肩膀
[02:36.060]上扛着一个脑袋所以
[02:37.400]只能在大街上浪
[02:38.810]每当 夜幕降临在大街小巷
[02:41.040]
[02:41.600]有多少带着理想的孩子
[02:43.200]被人遗忘
[02:44.270]我不想再当下一个
[02:45.520]所以开始用心
[02:46.720]这就是为什么现在
[02:47.830]你能听到我的声音
[02:49.110]
[02:49.810]虽然只有靠两个初步抵入
[02:52.030]但这是一条属于穷孩子走的路
[02:54.610]拿最真实的态度当做你的武术
[02:56.940]千万别让糊涂的社会
[02:58.300]乱了你的舞步

[00:37.14]因为今天是今天所以和昨天不一样对吗
[00:40.15]这就是你要的仪式感对吗
[00:42.58]对吗
[00:45.66]他以前不懂仪式感不知道这是你要的
[00:48.47]总是还没双手合十祷告就开始起跳了
[00:51.22]你总是说他草率
[00:52.71]他不理解还搞怪
[00:54.18]你想要把你的感受全部传他脑袋
[00:57.07]他总是木讷着祝贺
[00:58.68]对你说节日快乐
[01:00.11]对于他来说女孩的区别只是爱过和爱着

见面礼
作曲 : 司徒骏文
作词 : 两西、司徒骏文/司徒骏文
两西：
当夜幕降临 我在狰狞 放下酒瓶
人生是真情 在杯中 但时间总赢
曾拥有烦恼 是常伴 左右的步调
也开始让人思考权利自由讽刺像是忠告
人生不过是场戏 你我都知
别太埋冤现实 你也曾劝我深思
有时声情 并茂 为了得到 为了讨好 
像孤独被打扰 想微笑 
可惜这场戏没主角
你也会将就着过 收获着失落
也会有开心 有沉默 想把问题击破
或者换一种生活 换一个我
你向右边 我往左
也许就是 你想得到的结果
我们都习惯了 彼此的背影 习惯了路
思维很可恶 相互间都在抵触
记忆是种付出 也回顾
梦里那张图 还清楚 在吹促 在悔悟

司徒骏文：
万源都始于情，兄弟你听。
到头是你要的戏，
莫看的如此透，心会疲，
尽力见自己，各路阶梯各自行。
万物是始于零，兄弟你听。
到头是你要的醒。
莫在意是非颂，总会停，
多一些难题，筛剩的当见面礼。


两西：
我承认 我们很难用语言去解释
风凉的假话 只会显得很幼稚
陌生充斥着这个寂寞的城市
我们是朋友 或才认识 都像种讽刺
有首歌唱过 这是种表演 
很多的瞬间 很多人出现 很多在消遣
有时候在身边 却没有聊重点
有隔阂在中间 表达也存在风险
所以孤独时想找人倾诉
文字像病毒 总让人死不瞑目
每个人心里面都清楚 
我们只是应付 
传达悲观 我们却 相互庆祝 
意识的形态 阻碍温暖的关怀
是每个期待 否定着未来 
你也会笑我活该 
人群中我们再次说拜拜 
然后转身离开 

司徒骏文：
万源都始于情，兄弟你听。
到头是你要的戏，
莫看的如此透，心会疲，
尽力见自己，各路阶梯各自行。
万物是始于零，兄弟你听。
到头是你要的醒。
莫在意是非颂，总会停，
多一些难题，筛剩的当见面礼。

追风少年
作曲 : 李啦LILA4
作词 : 两西
我曾今做个梦 在很久以前
手握着麦克风 把文字组成语言
然后在灯光下表演
成为了焦点 观众的笑脸
是努力汗水 最好的加冕
那年我十六岁 做梦的好年纪
上学是机会 却先择音乐 被嫌弃
我穿着很另类 和社会不统一
校长开先例 把我当废人踢出去
从此 我变成一个孤独的人
象征着失败 未来似乎已没有可能
曾今那些亲爱的他们 
投来异样的眼神
像告捷你的人生 
以提前结束流程
可当你待在黑暗 便不再害怕
当你一无所有 便不再牵挂
你明白现实很复杂 
总需要摩擦 配合时钟的“啼嗒”
被冲刷 相信爱会治愈伤疤


他在奔跑 在祈祷 在思考 是自找
的烦恼 像配套 不断被围绕
他知道 神预料 是对症 后下药
梦想会预兆 你嘴角的微笑 
追 追 追 追风少年 光明一直浮在现在我眼前
追 追 追 追风少年 少年从来不计较生活在边缘
追 追 追 追风少年 黑暗使希望映入眼廉
追 追 追 追风少年 特会实现 特曾说过的诺言


后来他 独自进入社会 独自面对
琐碎 独自进退 
独自缴纳经费 微薄的薪水 也珍贵
他从没后悔 为此呆在底层岗位
他听过那句话 路在脚下 
没人能回答 因为不够伟大
他只是跟着心出发 单纯想被记住 
用爱把梦驻扎 从来没畏惧坟墓
这一路上 总是会有鄙视的眼光
伴随着你成长 你的疯狂
你的善良 是导航 梦想是桨
没有什么能将你阻挡 
收获舞台下的鼓掌
你开始相信付出回报 相同重要
别呆在原地烦恼 烦恼没钞票
向着前方奔跑 是唯一的止疼药
你明了 会做到 不需要谁来颁发执照

[00:19.560]又想起你曾对我说的话
[00:20.870]分开时又曾挨了多少骂
[00:23.950]我也一直尝试坚持还是一直对你偏执那些日子里面为你打的架
[00:29.060]不知为什么一切成了空 你像是雪里抓不住的风
[00:33.320]微信里给你发的消息百里挑一伴你朝夕在我脑海里面不停发着嗡
[00:39.380]我在记忆里每天不停寻找 我开始懂得何为岁月陈好
[00:43.780]每天幻想着你的身体却找不到你的身影一个人去你最爱的群岛
[00:50.910]这感觉就好像是陷入泥塘 可我却演变成了踏故习常
[00:54.670]寂寞它让我猝不及防在这圈子里面迷茫挥之不去的是你的皮囊
[00:58.480]你在我思绪里面神出鬼入 不知不觉间就能扰乱我的纬度
[01:02.180]那时你经常说我幼稚生活让我丧失斗志到现在我才突然悔悟
[01:08.000]可我已寻觅不到你的踪迹 思念它像一把刀一样锋利
[01:12.880]脑海里两个我在争议像是蜜蜂丢了蜂蜜房间里消失不见的空气

[01:37.730]Baby i love U u know 在每一秒钟 I love U u know 还想牵你的手
[01:48.350]和你淋雨一起走 要这不是梦 陪你到最后 永远都不回头
[01:57.610]我想起我曾跟你探讨到底什么才是恋爱 想和你永远都能一起保持现在
[02:02.270]时常和你争吵对你声讨 到头来发现感情是我欠债
[02:06.730]还想你能够回到我的身旁 想把你珍藏 不去浪漫的土耳其更不去敦煌
[02:12.400]我只想带你回到那天夏天 回到那天 想和你拥抱在无人的大街
[02:17.270]在萧条的夜里带着**的液体 你就像行走的春药让我根本不能自已
[02:21.950]在那个安静的凌晨两个干净的灵魂 把你拥入怀中就是对我操劳的谢礼
[02:27.010]我愿意为你甩掉我的那些坏习惯 陪你在身旁让你感受我的爱弥漫
[02:32.230]把你放在我的朋友圈然后等有天 做个炫妻狂魔那种感觉太奇幻
[02:37.240]Baby i love U u know 在每一秒钟 I love U u know 还想牵你的手

[00:36.415]酒吧里熙熙攘攘 顺城巷边吹着风
[00:38.939]座位旁空无一人 我做着白日梦
[00:41.287]不想再看电话还有微信朋友圈
[00:43.374]世界如此热闹 只有我在耗时间
[00:45.796]同学们各奔天涯 都看似事业有成

[02:36.962]淋湿了沉睡的痛它在你心底绵延
[02:39.298]直到那破碎的故事无法诉诸语言
[02:41.552]或许该离开这座围城也切断以前
[02:44.124]但是我真的忘不掉回民街熟悉的味道
[02:46.383]每一次亲切的微笑跟偶遇

[by:九九Lrc歌词网～www.99Lrc.net]
[00:08.20]Regardless of all the prejudice in the past
[00:10.51]today i wanna restore the impression you have on my country, China,
[00:13.89]which have been exactly fabricated by media for a long time
[00:17.53]As an individual citizen based in south west of the country,
[00:21.00]i wanna speak it then
[00:22.63]You guys can know better about what the truth is and
[00:24.93]how Chinese people assess their own country
[00:26.89]and how much we don’t wanna be disputants
[00:28.55]First things first, we all know that China is a developing country
[00:31.79]it has large population and it is really hard to manage
[00:34.31]especially after world war 2, almost perished
[00:36.92]i mean what i say is true, war is always scary
[00:39.59]it is real that the pollution is severe at the present stage
[00:42.27]in big cities like Beijing, Tianjin
[00:44.13]Always pollution haze
[00:45.18]Similar to 1950s, London and LA
[00:47.70]It’s painful with higher growth rate, you see?
[00:49.87]People are too busy with business
[00:51.27]everybody wanna have a better life
[00:53.09]Make money, get married
[00:54.49]But they are like the first or sec. generation of rich
[00:57.22]not well-educated
[00:58.24]But now young men like us, aspiring and friendly
[01:02.45]This is China
[01:04.16]We love the country，we the Chi-phenomena
[01:06.73]The red dragon ain't no evil
[01:08.18]But a peaceful place
[01:09.14]The beautiful land with rich culture remain
[01:13.37]This is China
[01:14.89]We love the country，we the Chi-phenomena
[01:17.19]The red dragon ain't no evil
[01:18.54]But a peaceful place
[01:19.60]The beautiful land with rich culture remain
[01:22.10]At the second verse
[01:23.11]It's really painful to point out the problems as they are too much for us to even think about and mention
[01:27.87]The food & drug security event
[01:28.99]Melamine Milk had affected 40 thousand babies and they all suffered from malnutrition
[01:32.87]What's more, there was the Vaccination issue.
[01:35.09]Illegal business operation has caused expiration and led to The panic in domestic
[01:39.70]What's wrong with the businessmen
[01:41.00]and it's reasonless to do business riding on them babies
[01:43.57]the question is there were still somebody who wanted the situation to be worse
[01:46.95]And their name is
[01:47.60]you know who
[01:48.24]They will get US Dollar perks
[01:49.71]The Spy, the traitor, the liar and the money making jerks
[01:52.05]They are leading the public into another extreme and it worked
[01:54.45]Also it is shameful to talk about some politicians
[01:57.02]because of their corruption and malversation in bidding sessions
[01:59.25]Their sexual pics and the prostitution scandals
[02:01.83]are all as a disgrace to the country and its people
[02:04.86]You are prolly also confused about the situation of Taiwan
[02:07.69]as you don't know the relationships between it and mainland
[02:10.18]Actually, for normal citizens, we just want us to be united as one
[02:12.85]cuz we think we are from one family, the same.
[02:17.60]This is China
[02:18.45]We love the country，we the Chi-phenomena
[02:21.17]The red dragon ain't no evil
[02:22.29]But a peaceful place
[02:23.60]The beautiful land with rich culture remain
[02:28.66]This is China
[02:29.51]We love the country，we the Chi-phenomena
[02:31.73]The red dragon ain't no evil
[02:33.15]But a peaceful place
[02:34.11]The beautiful land with rich culture remain
[02:36.91]Although the country does have these terrible things to deal with
[02:39.69]We've made a progress and we are trying to prevent these happening
[02:42.32]The power of Chinese people in China are gradually proving
[02:45.15]that we can make a better world as we love peace and harmony
[02:47.67]Through developing mobile payment,
[02:49.24]we can now use apps to pay in nearly all the situations
[02:52.07]even to make an appointment with the doctors
[02:54.25]We don't have to wait in line and try so hard, cost so much to just pay to register
[02:57.89]Meanwhile, we can trust the public security
[02:59.86]cuz the policemen are kind to citizens but crucial to our enemies
[03:03.15]We have tight gun control laws and we don't fear gun slaughtering
[03:06.18]cuz only cops and soldiers are able to touch it
[03:08.56]As for scientific achievement, we have Tu Youyou who discovered astemisinin.
[03:12.36]Also there are KBBF crystal and Shenzhou series in astronomy.
[03:16.20]We are now leading the developing or poor and backward countries
[03:19.54]In technology, economy, science and other aspects
[03:22.02]to make a better world just like the old, old history
[03:24.55]Yes, we want the recovery
[03:26.42]just for a better living and our great, great China Dream
[03:29.39]You see?
[03:32.61]This is China
[03:33.26]We love the country，we the Chi-phenomena
[03:35.64]The red dragon ain't no evil
[03:36.85]But a peaceful place
[03:38.17]The beautiful land with rich culture remain
[03:43.16]This is China
[03:44.13]We love the country，we the Chi-phenomena
[03:46.40]The red dragon ain't no evil
[03:48.01]But a peaceful place
[03:48.92]The beautiful land with rich culture remain

［Intro］
16珍珠鸟
真好
［ROAST FAT］
你好
原来你也起着么早
昨晚没睡着
都没来得及洗澡
看你穿的挺好
肯定挣得不少
不说了 赶不上车了我得先撂
报告 报告 我有张票
一共27块能不能报销
不知道 我得问问领导
一会儿开完会再说 你说好不好
［基因金］
哎幸会幸会 您好您好
刚才没回因为手机静音没听着
哦哦哦 昨我没接因为正好在洗澡
您简要聊聊 今我准备要早睡觉
不好意思 您这预算太少
没钱没时间这真干不了
上回的尾款我还没收着
记得您当时说跑的了和尚跑不了庙
［HOOK］
真好
朋友送我一只珍珠鸟
信赖创造出美好的境界 
一分钱一分货别夸我敬业
［基因金］
喝太多酒有一点上头
不用准备随时张口
外强中干的身体你其实长满伤口
我不写脏的歌根本不需要朗朗上口
嘲笑我地上你可以跟我回地下
你靠黑帕挣钱 我靠的是其他
假狠话太rua别提你可笑的计划
我玩说唱是爱好你丫因为学习差
 和朋友把时间都挥霍
 姑娘从五道口到美国
你脑门上刻着俩字水货
你高中上自习课哥们早就起飞过
小朋友快立正站好 烦恼 别再来找我盘道
你鸡贼的算计被基因金看到 暗号 我送你九泉含笑
［HOOK］
真好
朋友送我一只珍珠鸟
信赖创造出美好的境界 
一分钱一分货别夸我敬业
［ROAST FAT］
都是笼中鸟
梦里花钱知多少
绝大多数都是为了吃饱
睡觉 大炮
筑自己的巢
外面裹着藤条
大声的叫
没完没了 你却跑不了
社会浮躁
国际新闻不知道
逃避无非就是喝酒 吃药 
瞎胡闹 忘了自己的本
学着装狠 不能忍
数据架空历史计算精准
看看掉没掉粉
社交软件无法评论
时代他转着车轮不能停顿
［Outro］
我笔尖一动
流泻下一时的感受
信赖往往创造出美好的境界

唱给这座城市里两个伤心的人
beat by shiloh dynasty
合声 eunjoo
没有必要不停问我how i feel now
life is trouble 快乐全被 sold out
people come goes around and left real quick
是谁把心碎在这陌生的都会
他们只想终止无意义的social 
拉着一个爱他的人一起go home
再把所有伤心的细胞都兜售之后不再让有心的人从身边溜走
you are a stranger 
she wonders why i
i don‘t trust nobody 
not even her
是否你还爱着那几年的你爱他的时候就像一个磕了违禁药的疯子一样crazy
是否你还记得那几年的她骗你的时候就像一个gold digger 一样bitch
一样清晰的画面往往总在
你无法逃出这些无尽的阻碍和等待
可你刚要烧掉她的时候
可能会有个人躲在床下说着bae thats my bad
you are a stranger 
she wonders why i
i don‘t trust nobody 
not even her
谁得身上还没留过几道疤ang
谁得旁边还没遇过几个渣子
谁得人生不得经历一场drama
谁得心上不是扎了一把叉子
谁得身上还没留过几道疤ang
谁得旁边还没遇过几个渣子
谁得灵魂都要找到一个家ang
谁得心里都会留着一个她ang

LOVE OR HATE
作曲 : Lucid Soundz
作词 : Yee
你爱的是我另外一个世界
然而这个世界我给的会更加直接
也许爱的期限甚至不会大于十天
但为此付出变得更强我决不食言
希望 为了我 对着你
愿耳机里唱着对的MELODY
我并不需要plan B
所以没再锤头叹着气
若我的歌词能够拯救
厄运不会绊倒你
将我经历探讨起
苦和痛全都烂脑里
wait
当我身处黑暗当我选择相信
当我选择去爱但爱显得特别僵硬
我愧对 已坠毁 是没味蕾的爱
统统被现实这表示抛弃
you need me
you love me
我何曾不想把你包庇
甚至能够放下我该有的朝气
Forget my stroy Forget my pain
爱价值大过gold chain
这些他们都无法抄袭
you know me ?
谁希望变坏？ 谁会不渴望被爱
谁胳膊朝外？覆盖 无奈？无碍 to die!
现实 谎言 藏在 口袋 演技 出彩
让我 不在 等待 看开 滚开
抄我的能够叫做借鉴？
不入流的东西有人会为我划出界限
本分的人发出的恨你应该说声谢谢
不服请到长沙南边带队来找我练练
千万别怕 假rapper抱好吉他
太渣的8个8被践踏听众都聋了关注他们眼瞎
风大的听不懂话 队站的挺帅挺炸
朋友圈你发你吗 去喝个假酒几扎
我已经看厌了 再见吧
烂圈子 这么烂还玩点叛变的
思想没得撒钱到成了概念呢
you fucking kidding me
跟风的混全秒他们都太贱了
歌词没点水准走下形式都是rapper除了一起哈啤
一起DAB喊着yayaya
城乡结合部的孩子假的supreme假的yeezy都是嘻哈
大师跳跳蛙在呱呱呱
这里心机太多了恨把爱盖过了听民谣的把hipa撕开
把wifi夺了 不然白白活了 不听就显人太搓了
一开口就要关的歌 他们拜成佛了
所以去难得的那里南边
LOW能够给你打个够酷的结
别敲字就是说唱又会搓碟
一有风就要开始到处学
为了这里可怜的爱赶快回家找到你的MOMMY
千万别再说着Pussy weed 还有money
快把你们装不好的逼 马上收起
这里惨状接受改造 立正稍息
"yes sir"
Love me hate me
对我来说无所谓
Love me hate me
对我来说无所谓
LOVE ME HATE ME 对我来说无所谓···

[00:02.92]编曲：P$YCHO
[00:05.48]
[00:15.96]时常会在凌晨的三点种 睡不着的夜里我会拿起笔
[00:19.92]想把关于你的一切都删减空 控制不住总会想起你
[00:24.08]爱了不该爱的人就该忘了 握不住的沙就该放了
[00:27.80]你知道吗 现在的我 变成了你 最讨厌的样子
[00:31.92]对你的怨恨随着时间推移转眼都一点点的消散
[00:35.77]左边是天使 右边是恶魔在我脑海中一直不断的交战
[00:40.08]我猜中了开头却猜不中这结尾
[00:42.49]空荡的房间住着一个野鬼
[00:44.49]搞不懂是哪里错了
[00:45.99]余生不用指教了 我一个人过吧
[00:48.01]我从来不后悔 我曾经为你做过的一切
[00:52.22]如果时间能后退我想回到我们分手前的那一夜
[00:56.39]当争吵变成冷战 感情变的冷淡 你回到了没有我的世界
[01:00.30]感谢你的出现 教会我爱 我却再没有机会向你致谢
[01:04.44]那就走吧已经无所谓 何必搞的你和我都那么累
[01:08.28]这么大的男人哭的像个孩子一样第一次喝的那么醉
[01:12.46]现在我放纵我也学得会 每天在party不觉得累
[01:16.48]去tmd爱情吧 我想要说一句单身万万岁
[01:20.59]为什么要谈恋爱
[01:24.21]难道单身生活不够精彩
[01:28.59]明知道没有结果 不如就得过且过
[01:32.64]结局还不是一拍两散
[01:36.53]为什么要谈恋爱
[01:40.35]是不是单身生活不够精彩
[01:44.77]原来你只是过客 痛全部留给我了
[01:48.87]到最后我才明白
[01:53.17]如果人生若只如初见 多希望你没出现过
[01:57.25]傻傻的把你当作初恋注定没结果还一直在铺垫着
[02:01.03]可能是我太过认真 就好像被魔鬼上了身
[02:05.24]虽然我不想承认 但确实 沦陷的比你要深
[02:09.47]what the fuck 你变脸好快
[02:11.54]悲伤的气氛都被你搞坏
[02:13.33]前脚在哭 后脚就看到你坐他的车里面夸他好帅
[02:17.56]哈哈哈 是我太过傻 想起了曾经的指鹿为马
[02:21.55]不不不 是你太过假 我居然还为你把嗓子哭到哑
[02:25.70]看着镜子里的人不像人他可怜的像条狗
[02:29.72]曾经的主演现在变成观众像是马戏团的小丑
[02:33.70]你说分手不能做朋友 联络方式不能有
[02:37.82]就算在街上擦身 也当做没事发生 当个陌生的前男友
[02:41.94]为什么要谈恋爱
[02:45.78]难道单身生活不够精彩
[02:50.04]明知道没有结果 不如就得过且过
[02:54.02]结局还不是一拍两散
[02:58.12]为什么要谈恋爱

[00:35.92]即便经济危机横行我也不会亏损
[00:38.99]一无所有,也没有太多渴求
[00:41.09]但我不是绝望的代言,不用低头
[00:43.89]人类抛弃了动物,社会抛弃了人
[00:46.85]一个意识流的作者为自己开启了门
[00:49.41]一个人寻找着自己的定位
[00:51.88]不需要全世界来安慰我的伤悲
[00:54.87]无意中发现心碎是与生俱来
[00:57.64]就像我们哭泣着到来
[01:00.18]热恋中的你我更接近的伤口边缘
[01:02.93]爱得越深越容易泪流到天边
[01:06.50]一个人累,一个人睡,一个人疲惫
[01:09.28]一个人飞,一个人毁,一个人面对
[01:11.80]全人类都离散,我一个人悲
[01:14.73]全世界都背叛,我一个人背
[01:17.40]一个人累,一个人睡,一个人疲惫
[01:20.36]一个人飞,一个人毁,一个人面对
[01:22.88]全人类都离散,我一个人悲
[01:25.66]全世界都背叛,我一个人背
[01:28.63]周围太喧嚣,所以孤寂成了浪漫
[01:31.13]种种伤人的隐患在悄悄地上传
[01:33.59]青春年华转瞬即逝我们却意识不到
[01:36.54]路程很短,请不要心情不好
[01:39.35]我无法挽救自己的固执和任性
[01:41.95]人也难以改变自私的人性
[01:44.59]一个个时期,只有走过后才能看清
[01:47.39]只有时间知道是否值得为今天卖命
[01:50.05]远离了远离狂欢,一个人思考
[01:52.84]反省着荒唐,用什么方式吃饱
[01:55.48]拉上窗帘不再需要伪装的防备
[01:58.32]一个人忘记提醒自己就容易荒废
[02:01.07]年轮趁你不注意又多了几圈
[02:03.84]日子一过不知不觉就是几年
[02:06.64]理想莫名其妙就被丢弃在一边
[02:09.33]也许这是我们最脆弱的一面
[02:12.77]一个人累,一个人睡,一个人疲惫
[02:15.40]一个人飞,一个人毁,一个人面对
[02:17.91]全人类都离散,我一个人悲
[02:20.70]全世界都背叛,我一个人背
[02:23.58]一个人累,一个人睡,一个人疲惫
[02:26.45]一个人飞,一个人毁,一个人面对
[02:28.87]全人类都离散,我一人悲
[02:31.65]全世界都背叛,我一个人背
[02:35.83]一个人自言自语,告诫自己
[02:39.41]以免丧失了语言能力
[02:41.88]我赔着我度过了好多季节
[02:45.10]我是我自己的同桌一直到毕业
[02:49.08]眼泪蒸发到天空,变成了云
[02:53.14]降落到城市的雨,我一个人淋
[02:56.89]一个人累,一个人睡,一个人疲惫
[02:59.77]一个人飞,一个人毁,一个人面对
[03:02.18]全人类都离散,我一个人悲
[03:04.93]全世界都背叛,我一个人背
[03:07.95]一个人累,一个人睡,一个人疲惫
[03:10.70]一个人飞,一个人毁,一个人面对
[03:13.13]全人类都离散,我一人悲
[03:16.00]全世界都背叛,我一个人背


自己做决定
[by:于我的爱达荷]
[00:23.03]如果你問我 是否有困惑
[00:25.76]那答案是真的 想想也真扯
[00:28.58]有人争着 与现实交易着梦想
[00:31.32]我却像倔强的孩子紧抱着不放
[00:34.10]也路过 收购梦想的市场
[00:36.95]发现饶舌梦在那里没什么市场
[00:39.68]这世上总有几个主角很固执
[00:42.69]领衔着几个百折不挠的故事
[00:45.65]我和我的一意孤行走远了
[00:48.48]知道险恶 只能铤而走险了
[00:51.59]翻山越岭 过荒山野岭
[00:54.17]把杂念结冰 我下定了决心
[00:57.41](倔強的我)从哪一天起 从那一天起
[01:02.52](漫步在人海中)从哪一天起 我做了个决定
[01:08.66](那一天起)从哪一天起 从这一天起
[01:14.06](我下定了決心)从哪一天起 我下定了决心
[01:20.22]总是徘徊在出发点的门前
[01:22.63]将犹豫埋藏 一直伴随我成年
[01:25.57]或许是担心失败时我不太善辩能言
[01:28.23]又或许是面对失落感无法气定神闲
[01:31.22]时常望着 那模糊的镜面
[01:33.90]对抗着 失望的 是那仅存的信念
[01:36.99]空荡中 释放和梦想擦出的静电
[01:39.86]所期望的 又能否得到应验
[01:42.86]把那些扰乱的思绪放在脑中搅拌
[01:45.54]让我做个了断 是对自己的挑战
[01:48.50]又何必在意任何结果和所有原因
[01:51.17]下笔前的刹那间 我下定了决心
[01:54.58](倔強的我)从哪一天起 从那一天起
[02:00.01](漫步在人海中)从哪一天起 我做了个决定
[02:05.58](儿時的我沉溺在玩具中)从哪一天起 从这一天起
[02:13.33](這一天起 我下定了决心)从哪一天起 我下定了决心
[02:41.44]虽说不至于辗转难眠 但经常有难产
[02:44.89]有时写的自己越看越反感
[02:47.94]灵感的干旱 总是不期而至
[02:50.85]总跳不出格子 韵脚总是不合适
[02:53.34]会太过苛刻 有时对歌词
[02:56.57]对flow适可而止 不用太奢侈
[02:59.20]即便如此 也会钻牛角尖
[03:01.74]事倍功半的经历也有好些
[03:04.57]也有流产 也有想法会夭折
[03:07.49]也有顺产 却没见人来道贺
[03:10.42]我竭尽全力打造每一颗结晶
[03:13.31]这条路没捷径 我下定了决心
[03:28.98](倔強的我)从哪一天起 从那一天起
[03:34.31](漫步在人海中)从哪一天起 我做了个决定
[03:40.21](我抬起头 我一直走)从哪一天起 从这一天起
[03:45.80](那一天起 我下定了决心)从哪一天起 我下定了决心
[03:51.89](这一天起）从哪一天起 从那一天起
[03:57.48](我下定了决心)从哪一天起 我做了个决定
[04:06.18]从哪一天起 从这一天起(我下定了决心)
[04:11.84]从哪一天起 我下定了决心

[00:14.62]干嘛听苦情歌以为多浪漫
[00:17.01]再浪漫都被拆散
[00:18.75]说要平平淡淡
[00:19.67]长路漫漫一起再共患难
[00:21.63]
[00:22.21]高脚杯 在陪伴
[00:23.97]以为决定 多果断
[00:25.63]在青春 快过半的阶段
[00:27.20]失去了对爱的基本判断
[00:28.75]问我什么是爱
[00:29.54]是初亚当和夏娃 开心咬下苹果
[00:31.69]问我谁在抵赖
[00:32.86]是时间是金钱是你解不开的屏锁
[00:35.25]这场战役都没赢过
[00:36.90]航行中你无法停泊
[00:38.62]争吵从未停过
[00:39.70]但是彼此内心
[00:40.64]在不停祈求停火
[00:42.03]每个起因都有经过
[00:43.78]今后剧情是堂新课
[00:45.43]倔强的看不清回忆那曾经
[00:47.18]一分开就怪给星座
[00:48.90]失落的自己总责怪自己
[00:50.81]在黑夜中怒吼
[00:52.32]如果我是你会说我爱你
[00:54.22]在左转的路口
[00:55.17]说不上爱别说谎 就一点喜欢
[01:00.41]
[01:01.18]说不上恨别纠缠 别装作感叹
[01:06.78]
[01:08.08]就当作我太麻烦 不停让自己受伤
[01:11.95]我告诉我自己 感情就是这样
[01:17.17]
[01:18.19]怎么一不小心太疯狂
[01:22.43]
[01:23.24]用哪种方式纪念
[01:24.83]算最好的祭奠
[01:26.55]还会想跟你见面
[01:27.95]虽然只剩这张照片
[01:30.00]有开端就有结尾
[01:31.79]也许是一个机会
[01:33.50]在这匆匆流逝的岁月中
[01:35.30]你是记忆劫匪
[01:36.51]
[01:37.13]我想说声感谢
[01:38.46]毕竟你是最美好的节目
[01:40.23]多少次哽咽
[01:41.13]你的温柔我还一直记得住
[01:43.87]没有所谓对与错
[01:45.02]直到今天走到这一步
[01:47.19]所有怀疑都陨落
[01:48.55]当回头看走的这一路
[01:50.79]曾经爱过你恨过你
[01:52.35]想过你厌过你骗过你
[01:54.15]不停讲道理找刺激
[01:55.77]搞猫腻深陷这漩涡里
[01:57.66]现在 陪你迎风跑
[01:59.17]谁是你的避风岛
[02:01.01]如果不能问声好
[02:02.36]就让我来做你至尊宝
[02:03.88]说不上爱别说谎 就一点喜欢
[02:08.98]
[02:09.77]说不上恨别纠缠 别装作感叹
[02:15.65]
[02:16.55]就当作我太麻烦 不停让自己受伤
[02:20.49]我告诉我自己 感情就是这样
[02:25.84]
[02:26.73]怎么一不小心太疯狂
[02:31.12]
[02:32.84]别后悔 就算错过
[02:35.28]
[02:36.12]在以后 你少不免想起我
[02:40.23]
[02:41.89]还算不错
[02:44.21]
[02:45.47]当我不在你会不会难过
[02:48.46]
[02:49.21]你够不够我这样洒脱
[02:52.04]
[02:54.56]说不上爱别说谎
[02:56.61]深夜的徘徊是思念在捣乱
[02:58.31]就一点喜欢
[02:59.41]
[03:00.13]谁先放手谁又将给谁好看
[03:01.71]说不上恨别纠缠 别装作感叹
[03:03.86]烛光的对视变一个人的早餐
[03:06.43]将一切都体谅 将一切都原谅
[03:07.86]酒后的你又在对谁在期盼
[03:09.19]我尝试找答案 而答案很简单
[03:10.14]跳出爱的苦与疯
[03:11.11]很痛也必须放你走
[03:12.80]简单得很遗憾 因为成长
[03:13.76]我明白谁都有苦衷
[03:14.51]毕竟我牵过你的手
[03:16.17]我们逼不得已要习惯
[03:17.10]长大的过程中会有雷雨暴风
[03:19.43]
[03:19.97]那就珍惜每一秒每当你在我怀中
[03:23.03]因为成长 我们忽尔间说散就散

[00:21.35]你是片影子
[00:22.36]吸引我的追逐
[00:23.66]你是只野猫
[00:24.51]淘气的让人抓不住
[00:25.91]你是迷离的灯火
[00:27.18]引诱我的飞扑
[00:28.28]你是张地图

[00:32.18]找寻你的气味
[00:33.22]我想在山路蜿蜒
[00:34.26]众与你眼神匹配
[00:35.50]我想在污浊

[00:54.52]悄悄你走了
[00:55.55]被潇潇的北风刮走了
[00:57.37]独留下南郊的我挥手
[00:58.51]开口别瘦了
[00:59.74]最好你会忘掉
[01:00.65]把我名字给忘掉
[01:02.09]我甘愿做你人生中的一个逗号
[01:04.16]让最美好的诗经去散发他的光芒
[01:06.73]最卑劣的谩骂就留给我来担当
[01:09.10]枯萎的种子已不需要寻找幽光
[01:11.69]死去了的爱情才足够理由狂妄
[01:14.13]这条苦海无涯我已双脚踏上

[00:50]主角光环背后故事 用心早已看淡
[00:52]他们学不到的技术
[00:54]开始发奋记录
[00:56]狂上几个季度
[00:57]台下呼吸开始急促

[00:58]冲击眼前的迷雾但良心告诉我
[01:00]这种程度其实 还不够

[01:02]已经全副武装
[01:03]整理曾经被残留的那些 破遗物

[01:05]依赖药物的产物
[01:07]被时代淘汰的 破套路

[01:09]步履蹒跚的每一步
[01:10]坚持走到最后是否 迷了路


[01:12]Right we are fool

[02:32]No civilization no enough time
[02:35]Piece of my heart always want be the number 1
[02:38]Shat my head try again oh god damn


[02:40]当我守住初心 呵护良心
[02:42]目睹一切 病狂丧心
[02:44]当我突破自己  诸多谜题
[02:46]忘记地下鲜血 沾沾自喜
[02:47]一针一线缝补了旧伤口
[02:49]布满鲜血 誓死相守
[02:51]失去灵魂的瞳孔
[02:52]双眼凌晨的红肿


[02:53]欲望开出了花朵
[02:56]步伐沉重绑住了枷锁
[02:57]膨胀 碰撞 
[02:58]站在南北半球的隔海相望
[03:00]至少有相同的初心
[03:02]至少有相同的方向
[03:04]起点散发出的光亮
[03:05]还在平凡中荡漾
[03:07]Right we are fool
[03:09]What you gonna do？
[03:10]This way we choose
[03:12]What you gonna do？
[03:13]Transcend myself

[00:01.07]前方漫漫的长路 回头已没有归途
[00:06.41]我已经踏上征途 相信一定有归宿
[00:11.15]无数个夜里一人辗转反侧
[00:13.23]内心忐忑不知前方还有多少坎坷
[00:15.89]波折 也要把自由与爱的火把传播
[00:18.92]路通到罗马再奏响胜利的凯歌
[00:21.93]麻木的人群 无知的臣民
[00:24.60]彷徨的呐喊 可能已经没人听
[00:27.29]没有传承美德只传承了劣根性
[00:29.94]没有信仰的我们该如何走下去
[00:32.74]你为何笃定你的认知就是对
[00:35.46]真实的历史 上面都有一层灰
[00:38.17]甚至一切都是虚构 就像楚门的世界
[00:41.32]傲慢和偏见 暴露了你的视野
[00:44.00]Oh No 该怎么救赎 说实话
[00:46.92]我真的也不太不清楚
[00:49.12]每个人都应该是你自己的救世主
[00:51.98]只希望征途上不会再有残忍的杀戮
[00:55.37]为了海平面上的那道光
[00:58.65]为了信仰签下了生死状

[01:23.31]亲吻我的脸颊叮嘱我别再做挣扎
[01:28.59]那些苟且怎么可能让我轻易作罢
[01:34.49]勇敢无畏的心从来不会害怕奸诈
[01:39.60]肮脏的勾当 低俗的趣味
[01:41.94]畸形的审美 粗鄙的社会
[01:44.74]浑浊的空气 充斥着异味
[01:47.51]荒蛮的故事 我无言以对
[01:50.30]别妄想堵住我的喉咙 割了脉我也一定不收手
[01:53.11]发自内心呐喊的嘶吼 紧紧握住了真实的拳头
[01:55.71]现实残酷人性难免伤了我的心
[01:58.35]只要还剩一口气 我必定将掉你的军
[02:01.22]渺小到不能回头 我只是过了河的兵
[02:03.90]为了麦田里的孩子 有颗纯良的心
[02:06.70]为了艺术唤醒良知 不再有那肮脏的交易

[00:22.37]it's sad but it's still working
[00:25.64]大概怠惰了几天 草稿本反复涂改第九遍
[00:28.51]白教堂向南照常的路线 没兴趣再提炼任何字眼
[00:31.69]转换了思考的角度 依然是昏暗无光的重复
[00:34.91]看不出未来一丝的横竖 埋葬了幼稚可笑的企图
[00:38.09]分针再一步是零点 我懒得再继续体验
[00:41.31]怎看怎像烂影片 可拍庸碌从来不缺庸导演
[00:44.42]大声叫喊 活像个一切幸福可羡慕她痛苦的人
[00:48.46]多少人向往被抑郁症确诊 大多是油腻的肉身
[00:51.54]受够了烂情歌对假朋友隐瞒我过往的云烟
[00:54.45]还想在加勒比抽烟 听说你也有了新的起点
[00:57.20]陷在泥潭里遥远的美好不必再提起
[01:00.37]我更怕写不出歌曲尽管最后都毫无意义

[01:48.90]I can't be end up nobody I owe this shit for my family
[01:52.02]dealing with pressure and hatred always be up for the city
[01:55.29]爸爸再多给点时间妈妈也妈妈再多等几天
[01:58.05]一定把计划都给实现 血液里流淌我对它的想念
[02:01.28]见多了它的晚霞 却不能再感受它的春秋
[02:04.55]不能让来他们来安排我生活 多少人一辈子一场抓阄
[02:07.67]被给予的不少不多更担心偿还能不能够
[02:11.40]不再让自己享受首先要让家人满意点头
[02:14.21]当滥俗的饶舌都没去留下了真正忠诚的节奏
[02:17.33]等到我站在浪尖风口
[02:18.86]这一段将是最后的请求
[02:20.86]one step,two step

REAL DEAL HIPHOP REMIX
作曲 : 无/丹增 D The dreamer
作词 : 丹增 D The dreamer
我的梦想就是在华人黑怕刻下自己名字
一个大国肯定能包容黑怕这个新的名词
但是爱穿西装的人们开始抵制外来文化
不懂装懂的也开始rap 都扮成艺术家
红或不红我永远保持纯粹不会在去嫉妒他
在保持初心的同时填饱自己肚子这是我现在唯一想的
地下或者主流商业或者艺术何必在跟他继续犟呢
我希望误解在少点这让我怀念十几人的现场你我面对面
那会儿可能没有太多虚的包装但至少感动常在你说对不对

吃不起饭的未必是艺术家但我觉得他肯定是个懦夫
我可能说到了几年后的自己但h i p h o p 刻进骨子里直到我人生落幕


佛祖保佑！希望我永远都是自己
我永远记得自己名字所含意义
我永远以糌粑味的腔调感到自豪
我也何尝不想让自己过的好点
不会参加选秀节目在我的第一张mixtape我就提到
但现在好像除了这个就没有面包多么尴尬
我有别的出路么好像我现在真的别无他法 
都说我变了，但期间经历只有我自己懂
我经历欺骗独自一人对着空的瓶子不止一遍
感谢真的兄弟真的歌迷真的爱我的人给的感动
是你们让我继续拿起麦黑怕和你们在心底的位置谁都无法撼动

佛祖保佑希望我永远都是自己
我永远记得自己名字所含意义
我永远以糌粑味儿的腔调感到自豪

[00:11.698]我站在江湖之边 秋水与长天之间
[00:14.336]三尺微命 刻在碑亭 是名垂青史之篇
[00:17.456]一介书生 浪迹孤城 冯唐李广皆入梦
[00:20.655]冷月无声 雨落古筝 可叹这人生如梦
[00:23.647]你在那东篱之下 悠然就见了南山
[00:26.701]独坐饮清酒一碗 休怪我脚步蹒跚
[00:29.812]帘外碎雨潺潺 倒映着谁的江山
[00:32.867]梦里春意阑珊 且容我一响贪欢
[00:35.881]你看那兰亭之上 王羲之笔墨未干
[00:39.062]众人曲水流觞 古今事皆在杯盏
[00:42.170]阮籍狂啸山林 那嵇康大义巍然
[00:45.110]魏晋风骨已逝 广陵散化尘飞散
[00:48.245]山水间我逍遥阔步 与世俗形同陌路
[00:51.540]不同流合污 也不管旦夕祸福
[00:54.383]我行我素 算不上通今博古
[00:57.489]但要文人风骨 就算到穷途末路
[01:00.652]这长安明月照屋檐 细雨落在琴弦
[01:03.726]南风忽起 北雁南飞 相思留在心田
[01:06.781]山间古刹 清风入画 随白云到天边
[01:09.883]晨钟暮鼓 伴着浮屠 看尽沧海桑田X2
[01:25.458]我站在西子湖畔 岳王庙不动如山
[01:28.589]壮志未酬不甘 沦亡那大好河山
[01:31.390]精忠报国之志 青山也埋了忠骨
[01:34.396]敬仰武穆之时 请容我点根红烛
[01:37.787]遥想锦官城外 武侯祠松柏森森
[01:40.709]羽扇纶巾登台 那卧龙乃是真身
[01:43.721]三顾频烦 两朝开济 西蜀之地你来开辟
[01:46.918]鞠躬尽瘁 死而后已 千古一相尽是忠义
[01:50.050]你看那零丁洋边 丹心就照亮汗青
[01:52.933]文天祥一马当先 身边却尽是残兵
[01:55.991]只为心中正义 一如孟夫子之言
[01:58.992]吾善养浩然正气 屹立于天地之间
[02:02.422]天下兴亡 热血满腔 大丈夫要有所担当
[02:05.170]十年寒窗 扩土开疆 万军从中我匹马单枪
[02:08.343]不为功名利禄 也不想被谁纪念
[02:11.327]只求人们记住 这风骨也叫气节
[02:14.959]这长安明月照屋檐 细雨落在琴弦
[02:17.587]南风忽起 北雁南飞 相思留在心田
[02:20.546]山间古刹 清风入画 随白云到天边
[02:23.707]晨钟暮鼓 伴着浮屠 看尽沧海桑田X2
[02:39.652]长安明月屋檐照 细雨落琴弦
[02:45.736]南风起 北雁归 一曲相思谁人醉
[02:51.741]山间古寺清风绕 远上白云间
[02:58.168]晨落雪 暮落雨 滚滚红尘隧缘去

[00:15.490] Verse 1 Zinco泥鳅
[00:19.190] 我想每天睁开眼睛 就能对你说声早安
[00:22.090] 和你面对每件小事 虽然真的好难
[00:23.960] 我想知道你的口味是否和我一样
[00:26.790] 如果不是我会考虑翻新我的冰箱
[00:29.130] 和你在 每种天气进出每个场合
[00:31.490] 和你坐在日出山顶 看川流的江河
[00:33.970] 想给你送去雨伞 在你需要时候
[00:36.690] 也想在出远门的几天 接到你的问候
[00:39.090] 我想在每个很浪漫的场景握住你的手
[00:41.190] 如果剧情需要 当然也想亲吻你额头
[00:43.790] 我会推掉所有除你以外的事情
[00:46.530] 如果你感到委屈 或者不适应
[00:48.960] 我会把你写进我的每首歌的歌词
[00:51.590] 如果你不介意 也不对我推辞
[00:53.930] 我想让你帮我缝上无意蹭掉的纽扣
[00:56.690] 我就卧在沙发里欣赏你美到不可胜收
[00:58.290] DaisyCream
[00:59.000] 回忆里 我看着你
[01:05.000] 有夏天的气息
[01:06.000] Marvin Gaye
[01:06.800] Ah...you know we got to find a way
[01:12.800] to bring some lovin' here today yeah...
[01:16.100] Verse 2 Zinco泥鳅
[01:19.950] 八月末的温度 已经让人觉得舒服
[01:21.050] 因为没有你的存在 才尽量保持独处
[01:23.750] 吃好吃的小吃 为空气保持保湿
[01:26.050] 应付老师 老是考试 导致早餐不能早吃
[01:28.550] 绞尽脑汁 只想为你写一首诗
[01:31.050] 不了了之 是因为我的韵脚走失
[01:33.210] 为什么听了那么多的小情歌
[01:35.910] 还不知道 面对你用哪种表情呢
[01:38.850] 没有你在我有多难熬
[01:41.050] 没有你在 我有多难熬 多烦恼
[01:43.720] 没有你烦 我有多烦恼
[01:46.050] 没有你烦 我有多烦恼 多难熬
[01:48.250] 没有你在 我的乐趣都减半
[01:50.910] 情绪都保留 联络都剪断
[01:53.550] 没有你在 我的生活有点乱
[01:55.780] 时常难以入睡 难熬的九点半
[01:57.150] DaisyCream
[01:58.690] 回忆里 我看着你

[02:12.310] to bring some lovin' here today
[02:16.150] Verse 3 Zinco泥鳅
[02:17.950] 怎么会 我忙里偷闲看星座
[02:20.350] 对于将来的准备 我用心做
[02:23.050] 我当然看重结果 也注重经过
[02:25.750] 可美中不足的是 你看不见我
[02:27.850] 你看时间 年复一年 天复一天
[02:29.250] 让人融化的气温过后 雪花一片
[02:33.050] 你身边的人 换一遍又一遍
[02:35.450] 倒不如 细水长流 在我身边
[02:37.150] Sax Solo
[02:55.150] DaisyCream

[03:03.880] 远比现在熟悉

个人简介
[00:00.00] 作曲 : Robaholic
[00:01.00] 作词 : Zinco泥鳅
[00:03.090] 编曲/混音: Robaholic
[00:16.090] 咳...let's go
[00:18.090] 你应该知道 我这么帅的只会出现在动漫
[00:20.090] 要想明白你是不是我标准的共犯
[00:23.000] 我知道要走的路少不了动乱
[00:25.300] 但你放心 去的场景前所未有的梦幻
[00:27.890] 录音室是我常去的俱乐部
[00:29.790] 只要我拿起麦克风就从不缺热度
[00:32.090] 得分用假动作再配合一个后撤步
[00:34.590] 球鞋都救不了你 AJ还是换特步
[00:36.910] 二十二个年头走过不少分岔路
[00:39.010] 也受过不少伤 但从不用纱布
[00:41.410] 在人群面前说话习惯低八度
[00:43.710] 他们评价我只会说好JB酷
[00:46.340] 工作在押韵公司我得多加班
[00:48.340] 酒精在押韵中吃我的多巴胺
[00:50.540] 没学过跳舞也精通舞艺十八般
[00:52.970] 他们在念书我却报了吉他班
[00:55.710] 我走路带风可以这么形容
[01:00.100] 卖菜的大妈都表示对我很心动
[01:04.700] 穿金戴银对我来说无足轻重
[01:09.000] 当然掉了钱我也会感到很心痛
[01:14.000] 除了Hip-Hop 我还做点小生意
[01:16.000] 都打我主意所以职业病是打喷嚏
[01:18.800] 也会谈个恋爱 要玩点小甜蜜
[01:21.500] 因为人类的繁衍总归要延续
[01:23.300] 合作事宜尽量漂流瓶联系
[01:25.900] 除了比较难找还请你别嫌弃
[01:28.000] uh…还有 我不玩粉丝群
[01:30.100] 虽然很少回应但会看你私信
[01:32.700] 没太多私心 也没太多资金
[01:35.000] 但有可以阻止地球毁灭的自信
[01:37.400] 都说我命硬 这点我很庆幸
[01:39.800] 算命先生说我命好所以我信命
[01:42.000] 怎么水又满了你们又来抓泥鳅
[01:44.500] 请保护生态都抓走了怎么跟你chill
[01:46.800] 我又不是个大明星也不是个领袖
[01:49.000] 也常常找些朋友喝点小酒聊以后
[01:51.000] 我走路带风可以这么形容
[01:56.000] 卖菜的大妈都表示对我很心动
[02:00.000] 穿金戴银对我来说无足轻重
[02:05.000] 当然掉了钱我也会感到很心痛
[02:10.000] 身上刺个印 向偶像致个敬
[02:12.300] 怎么随意怎么来 别看作是个性
[02:14.500] 直到被勒令退学时才弄清我的特性
[02:17.260] 从出生就不会遵循某种设定
[02:19.120] 写的歌有没有模仿谁我真的不知道
[02:21.920] 所以随便去说我又不会去对你施暴
[02:24.000] 像个小学生聊世贸 还在关注次要
[02:26.700] 以极品制暴 就交给安全着陆制造
[02:29.000] 我走路带风可以这么形容
[02:33.000] 卖菜的大妈都表示对我很心动
[02:38.000] 穿金戴银对我来说无足轻重
[02:42.500] 当然掉了钱我也会感到很心痛

围墙外
[00:00.00] 作曲 : Sleepy cat
[00:01.00] 作词 : 前男友
[00:13.18]
[00:14.81]我已经沉睡了不知多久 身体的麻痹感逐渐清醒
[00:18.18]突然想要站起来 走出去看看 围墙外的风景
[00:21.69]
[00:22.15]这个围墙实在太高 而且我病着还
[00:25.61]想要出的出不去 想要进的也进不来
[00:29.17]
[00:29.33]太多人嘴上肝脑涂地的为你出着主意
[00:32.60]他们的外表无害其实内心当中藏了几只狐狸
[00:36.34]
[00:36.80]要么是为了钱 要么是图个色
[00:40.15]无非是功劳都归别人你就负责背个锅
[00:43.75]
[00:43.95]太多的框架和规矩你需要学习这一系列的套路
[00:47.31]很多的事情开始就早已注定结局却发现没人告诉
[00:50.97]这个圈子戒备真的森严 大家都在背地里面分钱
[00:54.69]这里不相信眼泪 更不需要那可笑的尊严
[00:58.21]
[00:58.37]你只能跪着爬 因为站得高才能够看得远
[01:01.75]搞不懂为了啥 在不同的人面前换着脸
[01:05.47]成功前没有人在乎你的曾经
[01:07.32]每时每刻都要绷紧神经
[01:09.10]不敢走夜路不是因为怕鬼？
[01:11.08]比鬼更可怕的是人心
[01:12.97]
[01:13.12]听说围墙外的生活安逸 人心也没那么糟糕
[01:16.53]出身卑微没有关系 你可以出门去踩个高跷
[01:20.00]付出和汇报成为正比 不用在每天都活在梦里
[01:23.73]人生这一辈子就这么长你的路不需要别人来送你
[01:27.13]
[01:27.53]在这物欲横流的社会中 我们都要轻点疯
[01:31.07]平凡的人要把不平凡的人生写入经典中
[01:34.73]有才华的不用靠脸 没才华的比你努力
[01:38.50]你想要的东西只会在汗水和泪水中产生
[01:41.82]
[01:41.99]求求你醒醒吧 你还要骗自己多久
[01:45.46]我已经翻到围墙外 你还在围墙里搓手
[01:49.26]希望你能够睁开双眼 不在偷鸡和摸狗
[01:52.82]但愿你的梦想他还在没有被时间拖走
[01:56.38]
[01:56.59]
[01:56.94]你最爱的女孩为了金钱她跟你分了手
[02:00.21]你最信任的兄弟在背后插刀他说你真的狗
[02:03.67]你最亲的家人走了 难道你要跟着走
[02:07.38]这个世界只有靠你自己你才是真富有
[02:10.89]
[02:11.14]我从来都不敢讲真心话 失去了兄弟我真心怕
[02:14.65]有时候忙碌的恨不得给自己出门去找一个分身吧
[02:18.16]学会改变能改变的 去接受不能改变的
[02:21.83]学会了当一个骗子 用金钱去换所谓的面子
[02:25.55]
[02:25.74]学会了很多的道理可我依然过不好这一生
[02:29.09]人生很短暂的 不过是眼睛一闭或一睁
[02:32.69]想想你做过的
[02:35.03]再想想你错过的
[02:36.78]最后想想你做错的 还有机会挽回嘛

[00:43.49]那就先让这首把未曾听闻给打破
[00:46.19]说实话我也没有什么十足的把握
[00:48.86]能让你动心再次播放这首歌
[00:51.65]我只是每天独自在家不知跟谁说说话
[00:54.54]所以决定问问陌生的你过得还好吗
[00:57.15]你还在上学读书或是毕业工作了
[00:59.86]会不会跟我一样在外偶尔想想家
[01:02.62]想问你今天早餐吃了没
[01:04.82]会不会好吃的让我馋嘴流口水
[01:07.12]你有没有养小猫小狗在你家里住
[01:09.64]尽管让人头疼却又把你给守护
[01:12.23]春天的风 微微的吹
[01:15.33]吹过你的美

[01:43.91]对了 你是什么星座
[01:46.38]你最喜欢的颜色是彩虹里的哪个
[01:48.76]你有没有在夜晚见过有流星划落
[01:51.48]想问问你许下最傻的愿望是什么
[01:54.11]突然好奇的想 我路过了街道
[01:57.46]正好这首在你耳朵里播报
[02:00.04]你认不得我 你在听我不知道
[02:02.64]但这种缘分真的好好好奇妙
[02:05.64]想一想 都觉得奇妙
[02:07.82]想一想 该如何问好
[02:10.72]尽管陌生  有你真好
[02:13.22]我想你知道 我想你知道
[02:15.91]想一想 都觉得奇妙
[02:18.44]想一想 该如何问好

空城计
[by:仰望星空孙连城]
[00:00.00] 作曲 : Zj-aIvSoN
[00:01.00] 作词 : GAI
[00:22.62]夕阳西下
[00:27.80]看这个世界真嘞大 于是啥子人都有
[00:32.19]时间永远不会停恶人也不会收手
[00:36.38]你怪别个心狠手辣当条狼或者是狗
[00:40.68]反正要获得更多善恶两面 必须都有
[00:44.97]山间有闲云野鹤 卧龙古琴小酌
[00:49.46]凭阴阳保乾坤没有想过要陷害哪个
[00:53.84]世人慌慌张张不过图碎银几两
[00:58.44]百年阳寿殆尽终究难逃黄土里躺
[01:02.47]做名垂千古的人不够流芳百世的先
[01:07.11]管你哪路嘞神兵来将挡水来土掩
[01:11.35]莽夫不清眉目 你跟我天壤之别
[01:15.58]只需闲庭信步 谈笑间横尸遍野
[01:20.02]老子一抬手就摸得到天
[01:24.16]看白云青山跟袅袅的烟
[01:28.45]在苦海寻欢虽回头无岸
[01:32.71]我潇洒坦荡行走在天地间
[01:37.28]老子一抬手就摸得到天
[01:41.90]看白云青山跟袅袅的烟
[01:46.19]在苦海寻欢虽回头无岸
[01:50.42]我潇洒坦荡行走在天地间
[01:55.86]敢问明月几时有 难饮尽我的乡愁
[02:04.42]糊涂明白各一头 劝英雄莫回首
[02:12.54]孤胆一夫当关 肯定就万夫莫开
[02:17.03]踱步羽扇纶巾 远眺我悠哉悠哉
[02:21.12]都是些凡夫俗子 你只会舞刀弄剑
[02:25.50]开山始祖在此 还不快过来拜见
[02:30.02]老子们仙风道骨 潇洒走空城之际
[02:34.26]你手拿三寸寒铁 看起你是真的喜剧
[02:38.50]天生是英雄豪杰 从不会计较太多
[02:43.03]反正是啥子样的人 肯定唱啥子样的歌
[02:47.50]比如 既生瑜 何生亮
[02:51.89]为了洗你们的脑 这个副歌跟到唱
[02:56.93]既生瑜 何生亮
[03:00.47]我晓得你看我不爽 但你也要跟到唱！
[03:05.01]老子一抬手就摸得到天
[03:09.19]看白云青山跟袅袅的烟
[03:13.48]在苦海寻欢虽回头无岸
[03:17.87]我潇洒坦荡行走在天地间
[03:22.26]老子一抬手就摸得到天
[03:26.54]看白云青山跟袅袅的烟
[03:30.88]在苦海寻欢虽回头无岸
[03:35.43]我潇洒坦荡行走在天地间
[03:40.46]莫让幽怨记心头 你我不过半壶酒
[03:48.84]策马奔腾何处走 我来世还复休

[01:32.65]顾虑是否堵住嘴
[01:33.82]不如迈开步履
[01:34.97]孤独都是顽强的匍匐
[01:36.39]真心需要临时补助

[02:16.30]有些看似和你共苦的人 其实挖着宝藏
[02:18.96]白费力气 恐怖的命运
[02:20.58]曾经夜里 被隔墙有耳的谁 灌醉了讲着道义
[02:24.17]讲 受难福音 教堂的空气越来越冰
[02:26.88]把每个自己贩卖后的他们 日进斗金
[02:29.51]做的梦 在如坐针毡

[03:25.79]现在的气氛让时间都 变得 缓慢
[03:28.10]真相在腐烂 他们在旁听
[03:29.97]对着灰墙的面壁 祈祷 绝无的转机
[03:32.62]获的罪 风干的泪
[03:34.16]看大都会 旧的宫殿 崩塌下坠
[03:36.85]每一个文明创造 涨停或 高峰
[03:39.10]我们坐吃等 山空

[00:11.65]迷失方向感 有你在身边
[00:14.20]每当孤单疲惫累 有你在身边
[00:16.83]感谢的话挂在嘴边没让你听见
[00:19.40]可我心里甜 可我心里甜
[00:22.02]觉得生活难 有你在身边
[00:24.81]每次想不醉不归 有你在身边
[00:27.36]感动瞬间故作镇定没让你发现
[00:29.95]可我心里甜 可我心里甜
[00:33.23]犹记得那是2014年的夏天
[00:36.01]我们偶遇在学校门口便利店
[00:38.72]这一刻好像是刻意等了好多年
[00:40.96]虽然我是真的没看清你的正脸
[00:43.62]在你的身旁悄悄经过 假装我没看着你的样子
[00:46.25]爱你的话心里轻轻说 想搭讪却还没想好句式
[00:49.30]我的世界场景和画面都为你静止
[00:52.21]想化身诗人将你提笔写入我的诗
[00:55.12]转眼间在一起已经过了三年
[00:57.67]但我爱你不需要丘比特来射箭
[01:00.13]好多眼泪我都强忍不留在你面前
[01:02.96]甚至让你开始怀疑我是不是没有泪腺
[01:04.76]迷失方向感 有你在身边
[01:07.77]每当孤单疲惫累 有你在身边
[01:10.27]感谢的话挂在嘴边没让你听见
[01:12.87]可我心里甜 可我心里甜
[01:15.43]觉得生活难 有你在身边
[01:18.23]每次想不醉不归 有你在身边
[01:20.73]感动瞬间故作镇定没让你发现
[01:23.38]可我心里甜 可我心里甜
[01:26.70]你总是说我粗心大意不把你放在心上
[01:29.37]其实是我不喜欢太矫情像一个小姑娘
[01:31.94]有好多次都是怪我不该无脑逞强
[01:34.42]我也没有办法 可能我aka生来倔强
[01:37.65]绞尽脑汁终于开始慢慢向你靠近
[01:40.00]找对了机会毫不犹豫只想把你抱紧
[01:42.66]我为你每天换发型 我变成外向型
[01:44.89]再陪你看抖音 就喜欢看你扬起的嘴角
[01:47.90]准备的礼物算不上很精致
[01:50.60]但一定带着我付出的心血
[01:53.40]就像是陪你聊天从来不分昼夜
[01:55.28]但无论坚持多久我也从来不会停歇
[01:59.85]我要感谢上帝让我遇见你
[02:03.41]但不是巧合 但不是巧合
[02:10.28]迷失方向感 有你在身边
[02:11.80]每当孤单疲惫累 有你在身边
[02:14.40]感谢的话挂在嘴边没让你听见

[02:24.98]感动瞬间故作镇定没让你发现
[02:27.69]可我心里甜 可我心里甜
[02:32.13]啦啦啦啦啦啦啦
[02:41.25]啦啦啦啦啦啦啦
[02:52.67]没人能停止我对你的想念
[02:57.77]钱包不装钱 全装你的相片
[03:03.30]没人能停止我对你的想念
[03:08.36]钱包不装钱 因为我没有钱
[03:14.38]迷失方向感 有你在身边
[03:16.54]每当孤单疲惫累 有你在身边

也许十年后
[00:00.00] 作曲 : Eminem
[00:00.00] 作词 : Kai.K
[00:00.000]mixed by DiDi
[00:01.421]VERSE 1
[00:06.059]又拿着手机带着耳机在备忘录写词
[00:09.654]这感觉如此熟悉 好像我一直坚持
[00:12.774]不知道是什么动机让我一直不断尝试
[00:15.974]写到现在也差不多半年 基本没有停滞
[00:19.198]也许 十年后我不会再继续写词
[00:22.222]也许再过个十年我大腹便便 还带着孩子
[00:25.614]有着不错的收入 温暖的家 和幸福的她
[00:28.590]不会再有专辑发布 也不会再唱嘻哈
[00:32.062]也许十年后 我会做个民谣歌手
[00:35.198]背着吉他带着她 环游世界到处奔走
[00:38.550]亲口 把十年前的我唱得脍炙人口
[00:41.598]希望音乐能够舒展街上紧锁的眉头
[00:44.766]也许十年后 我也有了自己的事业
[00:47.990]能在工作和生活找到平衡
[00:50.007]两者兼顾的境界 敬业地工作 同时 还能写写词
[00:54.368]歌词依旧带着能量 不需要我解释
[00:57.576]HOOK
[00:57.784]十年又十年 一生能有几个？
[01:00.528]要花多少个十年才能让这生活有起色？
[01:04.271]hey bro 不要杞人忧天 被时间绑架了
[01:07.111]told you so 过好每天 就会找到方向
[01:23.127]VERSE 2
[01:23.447]也许十年后 很多朋友不会再有问候
[01:26.544]就算 巧合相遇 在 某个陌生的街头
[01:29.608]从十年前开始我就是那么anti-social
[01:32.520]所以会格外珍惜和我保持联系的朋友
[01:35.910]也许十年后我不再是个耕耘代码的码农
[01:39.182]也不会在深夜debug到脑袋都发懵
[01:42.374]那我肯定 找到了 更 热爱的事情 把它替换
[01:45.534]因为 喜欢编程 这个结论 经过我缜密计算
[01:48.758]十年后我不再让别人看得到我的脆弱
[01:51.966]各种责任扛在肩上 要求自己不能落魄
[01:55.270]对错也能准确分清 遇事不会懦弱
[01:58.510]堕落这词在我心里从来没存在过
[02:01.790]十年后的我也过了 而立之年
[02:04.798]那是否能够做出点成就在那 而立之前
[02:08.014]至少能有几首歌 流传在那网络之间
[02:11.110]靠作品吸引听众 不带半点炒作之嫌
[02:14.470]HOOK
[02:14.909]十年又十年 一生能有几个？
[02:17.390]要花多少个十年才能让这生活有起色？
[02:20.534]hey bro 不要杞人忧天 被时间绑架了
[02:23.958]told you so 过好每天 就会找到方向
[02:39.965]VERSE 3
[02:40.101]也许十年后 时间让一切都变得不确定了
[02:43.141]西部世界都完结找到机器人的秘密了
[02:46.173]可能滴滴打车都能随便打到飞机了
[02:49.469]手机里只有一个软件肯定就是微信了
[02:52.741]可能嘻哈音乐已经变成市场主流
[02:55.789]世界杯决赛观众一起喊着中国足球
[02:59.757]社会的一切都好没有任何败类毒瘤
[03:02.181]不需再有神圣的岗位全天全年无休
[03:05.477]可能网络在提供便利的同时把一切都剥夺
[03:08.757]可能花一杯咖啡的钱就能把个人信息搜罗
[03:11.870]可能社交媒体都倒闭了只剩被管控的微博
[03:15.181]可能沉迷虚拟世界的人在家度过每个周末
[03:18.664]确定的是 这世界 有人走有人来
[03:21.208]有人一贫如洗有人却掌握大把钱财
[03:24.592]有人抱怨上帝不公
[03:26.599]猴子想变悟空
[03:28.063]想赚钱买套故宫
[03:29.408]再让haters胎死腹中
[03:31.232]于是我拿起笔把这些可能都写下
[03:34.136]十年后看看当时的自己会有什么思考
[03:37.454]但是当我发现过好每天才是正确的解药
[03:40.486]心中的目标慢慢清晰慢慢被我知晓
[03:43.686]不会再把时间浪费在那无谓的祷告
[03:46.950]阻挠我前进的累赘我会扣下扳机 开枪击到
[03:50.430]再学会去挣脱那些世俗枷锁和镣铐
[03:53.390]综合实力稳定发挥战无不胜的技巧
[03:56.794]不知不觉写到这
[03:58.298]能否退下保护色
[03:59.858]回顾过去 活在当下
[04:01.530]才是真正的快乐
[04:02.906]不要被压力压扁头
[04:04.650]成长的路都不好走
[04:06.266]但是咬牙走到头
[04:07.826]才发现成功总在风雨后，因为
[04:09.778]HOOK
[04:09.977]十年又十年 一生能有几个？
[04:12.544]要花多少个十年才能让这生活有起色？

最近无题(Prod by CJ-CPTMR)
[00:00.00] 作曲 : CJ-CPTMR
[00:00.07] 作词 : Kai.K
[00:01.714]VERSE 1-1
[00:29.516]还记得刚开始总是有无数的灵感
[00:32.423]充斥着我的大脑
[00:33.815]随便找个伴奏都能够轻易地将情感
[00:36.167]镶嵌在每个韵脚
[00:37.647]都怪多巴胺刺激大脑皮层发出愉悦的信号
[00:41.263]于是我奋不顾身地一头扎进这个伪嘻哈浪潮
[00:45.135]刚开始 把出歌看得比写歌更加重要
[00:48.576]用着韵脚不经思考 歌词堆砌 没有逻辑 自我感觉良好
[00:52.879]想用半桶的水
[00:54.415]去掀起骇浪惊涛
[00:56.431]简直就无可救药
[00:58.311]全都是粗制滥造
[01:00.039]HOOK
[01:00.415]我问你冲不冲 我问你懂不懂 我问你痛不痛 没关系反正大多都平庸
[01:07.727]不在乎冲不冲 不在乎懂不懂 不在乎痛不痛 没关系反正一切都成空
[01:15.279]我管你冲不冲 我管你懂不懂 我管你痛不痛 没关系反正我绝不会怂
[01:23.319]VERSE 1-2
[01:23.503]我在工位戴上耳机
[01:24.863]把周围的
[01:25.666]噪音都屏蔽
[01:26.607]思路变得清晰
[01:27.543]但犯困的天气
[01:28.527]思绪飞到天际
[01:29.471]无法专注编译
[01:30.455]难道这是天意
[01:31.423]好像没有秘密武器 安慰自己还年轻
[01:34.649]没什么不行 要继续努力 直到有实力比拼
[01:38.367]HOOK
[01:38.583]我问你冲不冲 我问你懂不懂 我问你痛不痛 没关系反正大多都平庸
[01:45.759]不在乎冲不冲 不在乎懂不懂 不在乎痛不痛 没关系反正一切都成空
[01:53.711]我管你冲不冲 我管你懂不懂 我管你痛不痛 没关系反正我绝不会怂
[02:01.311]VERSE 2-1
[02:01.506]感觉一切都上了轨道
[02:03.311]怀疑自己是否重要
[02:05.247]不愿接受边缘化的信号
[02:06.743]保持上进才是我的嗜好
[02:08.639]我怀念那些忙碌的日子
[02:10.847]虽然辛苦但过得充实
[02:12.759]要牛逼又想安逸的人
[02:14.591]根本就看不清这现实
[02:16.447]HOOK
[02:16.680]我问你冲不冲 我问你懂不懂 我问你痛不痛 没关系反正大多都平庸
[02:23.887]不在乎冲不冲 不在乎懂不懂 不在乎痛不痛 没关系反正一切都成空
[02:31.447]我管你冲不冲 我管你懂不懂 我管你痛不痛 没关系反正我绝不会怂
[02:39.455]VERSE 2-2
[02:39.599]也许根本就没人在乎
[02:41.439]何必把那么多精力倾注
[02:43.271]不会随便找人倾诉
[02:44.812]把情感都统统藏在深处
[02:47.007]别人成功要假装庆祝
[02:48.559]不要把心声过分表露
[02:50.712]先把该做的全都做好
[02:52.791]毕竟人多要加快脚步
[02:54.399]又是早高峰的一号线 我习惯带着耳机思考
[02:58.095]看着还没存够的机票钱 环游世界要先吃饱
[03:02.351]面对别人要挂着礼貌脸 打好关系要趁早
[03:06.167]毕竟我的资历还是比较浅 当个辅助刚刚好
[03:10.383]这几分钟
[03:11.311]想把大脑清空
[03:12.183]发现神经紧绷
[03:13.167]根本不能放松
[03:14.151]我的心中空洞
[03:15.095]在这痴人说梦
[03:16.063]反正没有听众
[03:16.951]我也不会心痛
[03:17.983]有人劝我要学会知足
[03:19.584]但我不会安于现状
[03:21.066]早习惯自学在网络私塾
[03:23.287]防止心中目标变样
[03:24.815]不在乎冲不冲 不在乎懂不懂 不在乎痛不痛 反正一切都成空

[00:10]  作曲：MGG
[00:16] 出门太阳光线照在我的脸上  盖不住broken soul 
[00:21] 寂寞夜晚只有手机放在身旁  来倾听what i know 
[00:25] 幸好还有我的homie homie  让我不会感觉 lonely lonely
[00:31]   nobody wanna talk with me with me  
[00:34] do u feel me  there is no one really  care about me  
[00:38] 形单影只的走在路口  i dont care about this shit wo
[00:43]  谁说孤掌难鸣独自也能解决问题或许精神超过肉体思考慢慢变成呼吸   
[00:49]  时常自我封闭总是喜欢想东想西对于爱情失去憧憬哪怕再去搜寻答应
[00:54]  iam so busy dont call me  i dont care about everthing
[01:00] 不强求 不在意 不关心 任何无关痛痒事情还有贬低我的enemy   
[01:05]  太多人已经失去能力 鉴别能力 就像个monkey 一样的live
[01:09] Duke.J
[01:10] who care 生活在你身上添了多少印记 
[01:13]  who care 努力后的失败对你又有多少意义
[01:16]  每个努力的夜晚只为了能够得到一个成功的契机
[01:20]  but who care身上背了多少他们贴的标签
[01:24] who care 又做了多少次不必要的道歉
[01:27] 为了变的圆滑又练习了多少次可笑的表演
[01:31]  but who care  我做了我最正确的决定，能一直做我喜欢的事情实属万幸
[01:36]  见过太多不同的人但性格依然感性，bro that what i talking a bout you know what i mean 
[01:43]  but who care who care ，its ma life idont want share i just fllow ma hart i think its real
[01:49]   我曾经确实穷困潦倒，但现在积累的财富将替我祷告
[01:52]  MGG
[01:53]  我试着努力接受  身边的狐朋狗友  尽量的视而不见  小丑的取宠表现  
[01:58]   为什么人生在世总要活在别人眼里  我看清一切只想更快到达我的目的
[02:04] Life life 生命短暂 you should know  让我的flow 去尽量填满内心的洞  
[02:10] Wanna know  我何时才会真正的dope  带来的hope完美取代心情的low
[02:15]  不再总是打扮幼稚吸引别人注意   我想做的事情让他变得更有意义
[02:20]  除了事业什么爱情都是shit woo  我集中注意坚实踩下每个阶梯woo   
[02:25] 每当我回忆  以前彷徨的时期  作为男人这是唯一让我后悔的事情  
[02:30]  用着만원짜리  不靠父母的积蓄 作为男人这是我最应该改变的事情
[02:36]  no mercy no mercy u should know me   Get money get money im rolling  
[02:42]  Who care who care  a little boy  向你证明varia太高无法企及
[02:47]  出门太阳光线照在我的脸上  盖不住broken soul 
[02:52]  寂寞夜晚只有手机放在身旁  来倾听what i know 
[02:57]  幸好还有我的homie homie  让我不会感觉lonely lonely
[03:02]  nobody wanna talk with me with me

[00:18.31]我清楚记得当时那些日夜
[00:20.27]怨天尤人痛恨你和这个世界
[00:22.49]也一度崩溃 大骂你是个jh
[00:24.79]你却对我说对我感情从未变过
[00:26.93]也想要变得洒脱变得什么都不想
[00:28.96]越发的蹦跑 却变成了不痛不痒
[00:31.39]我清楚的知道自己还有多少的时间
[00:33.56]等待我的到底是失败还是终点
[00:35.91]我曾经发誓让梦想它快长大
[00:37.95]可面对现实我懦弱不敢讲话
[00:40.20]我怕它将我心中的火苗给熄灭
[00:42.50]我害怕失败因为这是我的心血
[00:44.72]我早就厌了倦了说t声算了算了
[00:47.04]对自己说道自己看着办吧
[00:48.97]当你回过头来是否还看得到我
[00:51.46]脸上坚毅的表情是否早就变了
[00:53.62]愈发的奔跑 愈发的努力
[00:55.82]只有尝尽了过失败才会更有勇气
[00:57.99]丑恶的嘴脸他让我陷入
[01:00.36]想要把内心的阴暗面全部抹去
[01:02.40]说真的早就已经猜透了
[01:03.97]只是还没有hi够跤还没有摔够
[01:06.48]没有人拍手我怎能停下？
[01:08.15]父母身边还没呆够我如何再走啊？
[01:10.89]你们每次唠叨的话语其实我心里都十分清楚
[01:13.53]可却要装作很不耐烦对于那些叮嘱
[01:15.78]“你儿子那么废，干嘛要那么累？”
[01:18.00]我躲在房间那些对话听得多么清楚
[01:20.40]我不敢抱怨 对于烦恼
[01:22.49]要以德报怨把问题全部赶跑
[01:24.68]清楚的知道时间它还早
[01:26.88]我不乖自己平凡 只怪自己胆小
[01:47.67]特别绝望的那一次
[01:49.89]特别失望的那一次
[01:52.03]特别狼狈的那一次
[01:54.31]特别心狠的那一次
[01:55.98]在背后议论我
[01:57.00]说我的变化大
[01:58.02]从开始嘀咕到现在不断变大化
[02:00.29]可是我连成功的边缘都没有看到
[02:02.64]难道是暗号劝我趁早放弃
[02:04.86]我难以抗拒 也明白什么叫做小人见利忘义
[02:08.36]我清楚的记得当时对我叮嘱的是你现在回想起来全部放屁
[02:13.25]第一次才知道什么叫做真正的离别
[02:15.31]我们说好了以后一起穿西装和皮鞋
[02:17.56]你是不是应该跟我说句抱歉
[02:19.78]至今都不敢留你任何一张照片
[02:22.02]Look at me
[02:22.60]我不想拆穿 太多的谎话
[02:24.66]我知道只有受尽委屈才能长大
[02:26.88]就算风再大 我依然会放下
[02:29.18]除非我站不起来 不然不会倒下

[00:20.610]我并不希望我的人生只是一场梦而已
[00:23.433]我希望能够留下一些礼物将来送给你
[00:26.354]也许是我的故事我的歌
[00:27.930]或者我的牧师为我写的墓志铭上写着来自1989
[00:31.709]一生追寻着自由 什么都没有带走
[00:34.865]此生也不将在有
[00:36.442]所有拼搏的理由只是不想向人乞求
[00:39.138]如果有一天我倒下请将我的生命带走
[00:42.118]我的战友 别再颤抖 生死有命我早已看透
[00:46.796]在我战斗的地方仍会响起这只伴奏
[00:49.697]子弹头也没法将这信念给穿透
[00:52.273]在绕过许多弯后 在翻过许多山后
[00:54.930]得道没得道的 参透没参透
[00:57.468]聪明的人太多可难得是憨厚
[01:00.057]去冲破这路上的关口
[01:02.946]没有人能够带走我的自由
[01:07.857]来就来到这奔腾的海潮我拼命的奔跑
[01:12.001]就像股洪流
[01:14.766]循环不休 循环不休
[01:19.769]以生死成就让此生不朽
[01:23.390]人们梦转醒的时候总是痛到醒的时候
[01:25.415]而当痛到醒的时候人们才会真的觉醒
[01:28.441]谁又知道人生路它通往哪里
[01:30.647]如若是站在原地也不会有人答疑
[01:33.454]要继续加大马力才不会陷入杀机
[01:36.062]任词藻多么华丽都不如一篇札记
[01:38.985]这时代太多垃圾想成为话题
[01:41.206]pussy money weed都活在你的象牙塔里
[01:43.814]看着慌张的人群没有方向
[01:46.894]多少荒唐的事你觉得肮脏
[01:49.399]让你习惯一切变得麻木变得冷血
[01:51.809]直到所有人的头顶都被遮住光芒
[01:54.686]要做个闯荡者 呐喊着响亮的
[01:57.133]野性的呼唤让这里的人们仍是充满想象的
[02:00.334]我从那湘江河出发一路奔波一路风沙
[02:03.239]让你听到这声呼唤一起唱响着
[02:05.742]没有人能够带走我的自由
[02:10.431]来就来到这奔腾的海潮我拼命的奔跑
[02:14.388]就像股洪流
[02:17.549]循环不休 循环不休
[02:22.278]以生死成就让此生不朽
[02:25.847]我不会让我脚步有天停滞不前
[02:27.659]在出发前我也曾感到失落彻夜不眠
[02:30.350]年轻的生命我的同类为何一成不变
[02:32.960]乏味的思想称作潮流可谓十分肤浅
[02:35.582]学不会举一反三 大脑存百度网盘
[02:37.894]拿道听途说信口胡说手机成了感官
[02:40.609]rapper们信誓旦旦 为爱却引起乱战
[02:43.350]而无能之辈兢兢战战躲在角落只会暗算
[02:46.134]很难以相信 可历史总是相近
[02:48.630]是战与火的独白作为主宰照耀出的光影
[02:51.358]如期放映 正上映 这战斗让你上瘾
[02:54.014]你战斗为了什么？为了自己获得更多
[02:56.550]而你却在说是为了自由 我得挣脱
[02:58.918]真正的自由会在内心为我解答困惑
[03:01.670]前面有多少风波是否燃气连天烽火
[03:04.214]做仁者无敌天下 有谁能和我争夺
[03:07.447]没有人能够带走我的自由
[03:13.213]来就来到这奔腾的海潮我拼命的奔跑
[03:17.158]就像股洪流
[03:19.718]循环不休 循环不休

[01:03.43]午夜的未接来电我又拨打了一遍又一遍
[01:07.46]我想要听我的脉搏心跳却又断了线
[01:11.00]睡梦中你的身影我复习了一面又一面

[02:56.87]我落魄的样子谁也不能忍心看的见
[03:00.74]配不配， 对不对, 你怎么样我都无所谓
[03:04.66]睡不睡，累不累，从来都不害怕浪费
[03:08.31]你可千万不要嫌弃我身上掩盖的烟酒味

[00:51.999]行色匆匆 总是睡眼昏沉
[00:54.810]雨后的世界 潮湿又沉沦

[01:00.297]是什么总是让你义无反顾
[01:03.149]又是什么总是让你体无完肤
[01:05.657]你总是顽固 总被那过往缠住

[01:26.561]总是患得患失 独自漫步在这寒夜
[01:29.353]这城市繁星满天 无心眷恋徘徊
[01:32.424]不知道该来的人 什么时候才来

[02:32.689]麻痹着 孤单着 在这里迷失了
[02:38.912]猜疑着 怀疑着 在这里相信着
[02:43.746]
[02:44.517]咖啡凉了 窗外模糊的风景
[02:47.877]雨水打着 屋檐晃动的风铃
[02:50.583]闭眼想着 你总质疑着自己
[02:53.343]人生苦短 那是否一切都有意义
[02:56.280]你时常怀疑一切是否值得拥有
[02:59.199]想珍惜的时候你却已一无所有
[03:02.162]也把玩着梦想守护它们不被冲走
[03:04.577]但如果总是迎来失望你还能撑多久
[03:07.606]那该怎么办呢 路是自己选的
[03:10.644]别人都在看呢 还得继续演着
[03:13.106]这世上有太多人都被情感牵扯着
[03:15.948]也有太多的如果早就被你割舍了
[03:19.133]如果你从未改变
[03:22.110]如果你从不怀念
[03:24.680]那些越来越坏的 不是你的视力
[03:27.396]你看不清这世界 也看不清你自己
[03:32.774]
[03:42.623]Trapped in the city

[01:06]还想把我梦想做大 然后再顺藤摸瓜 把黑特一笔抹杀 
[01:10]让你们知道我玩说唱不是装疯做傻
[01:13]我的 父母 希望我 找一份 稳定的 工作 
[01:16]但我 想要 靠我 双手 为 梦想而拼搏 
[01:19]我也曾想让父母过上更好的生活 
[01:21]我 现在 闭上眼 在梦中 都是我修成正果。
[01:35]一路走来从1996走到2018
[01:37]我们不断成长也经历过了许多激发
[01:40]从爸爸手上的童年玩具变成苹果手机
[01:43]父母对我们的现在是满意还是不如预期
[01:45]时光飞逝 曾经 飘扬胸前的 红色领巾
[01:48]现在换成 印刻 胸上意义的 黑白刺青
[01:51]记载着梦记载承诺记载痛
[01:54]却忘了少年时候捉迷藏你躲在的是哪一栋
[01:56]我也 从没 想过 我 就要 这么 步入社会
[01:59]我的 父母 也 因为 我的 幼稚 气炸了肺
[02:01]我 以为 只要 努力 就能 如鱼得水
[02:04]可 这现实 就是 显得 我 如此的可悲
[02:06]可是 爸爸 你 从来 不会这么将我责备
[02:09]感谢 你们 给我 一次次 改过的 机会
[02:12]还有 妈妈 你 为我 流过 伤心的 眼泪
[02:14]这世上一切的爱都比这些来的卑微
[02:17]我答应你们这些教诲我不会违背 
[02:20]就算再痛也会供起我受伤的背
[02:22]就在2018相信我一切都会步入正轨 
[02:25]我决定的事情打死我都不会后悔

[00:21.14]难道真的要吞下这份屈辱
[00:23.26]难道说国难当头还要让我们继续让步
[00:25.62]难道 真要 对一切熟视无睹
[00:28.13]眼睁睁看着被划掉的国土再也抬不起头颅难道
[00:31.25]帝国列强对我们虎视眈眈
[00:32.94]膨胀的野心不停的盘算不停的纠缠
[00:35.59]谁可以救我们
[00:36.66]不是那无能的北洋政府
[00:37.95]只有我们自己能救自己
[00:39.37]不愿做奴隶的人们
[00:40.96]巴黎和会的消息传到北平
[00:42.60]从人们眼里能看到摇曳风中的命运
[00:44.91]哪怕我不是王公贵族将门之后出身
[00:47.23]作为中国青年也要扛起这份责任
[00:49.54]我只是一个普通平凡无奇的学生
[00:52.05]但国之兴亡匹夫有责没有任何疑问
[00:54.42]只要有书在图书馆里就能睡得安稳
[00:56.83]可如今国之屈辱让我辗转反侧只想为民族斗争
[00:59.97]今天是5月4号
[01:01.28]各大高校同胞聚集高喊外争国权 内惩**
[01:04.18]还我领土山东
[01:05.29]我们为此冲锋
[01:06.49]让世界看看中华青年为此弃笔从戎
[01:08.91]巴黎和会终于落下帷幕
[01:11.35]我们不会签字不会再让人肆意欺辱
[01:13.72]今天会被重笔记录
[01:15.19]五四运动只是一个序幕
[01:16.37]这是我的故事
[01:17.42]就让我今天讲述

[01:33.05]一闪一闪发光 就像宝石
[01:37.83]I used to be a staff in a Sino-foreign joint venture company
[01:41.08]Prejudice at that time was worse than I had learned in my college
[01:44.70]Every time I picked up my phone to sell products to the western
[01:47.21]I got phone call terminated when I said “I am from China”
[01:50.75]words ain’t finished ’fore they hung up
[01:52.78]I made up my mind to change this whole thing
[01:54.72]I took off my suit and tie to start rapping
[01:57.19]Then I locked myself up in the studio
[01:59.22]I wrote my words and poured my ink with pure intention
[02:02.66]-to restore the old impression western people had on China
[02:05.33]I just hoped they’d listen
[02:06.68]Then the hit “This is China” came out
[02:08.92]Applause and flower
[02:10.10]But foreign media were pissed off
[02:11.71]Seems like I had to fight with BBC
[02:13.69]and those fake news orgs’
[02:14.90]“Another Beauty” y’all
[02:16.96]Nowadays I feel
[02:18.09]like China's getting better
[02:19.63]We living in a good life
[02:21.55]But never get conceited
[02:22.65]Be humble and be prepared
[02:24.32]Overcome weakness and be aware
[02:25.77]All walks of life
[02:27.05]No matter what we are
[02:28.24]we’ve done a great job
[02:29.54]But we still have to fight
[02:30.69]I’m a rapper
[02:31.77]lyrics are my bullets to shoot
[02:33.24]This is my story and the things I gotta do
[02:34.98]How about you？

[00:24.59]不知道你现在在哪里
[00:26.94]过得好不好 有没有很开心
[00:29.82]从你的世界里面消失以后
[00:32.79]不知道有没有 曾经被想起
[00:35.85]记忆模糊了 画面消失了
[00:38.89]还能记得起的只有你的眼睛
[00:41.90]音乐响起了 阳光铺满了
[00:44.88]如今的我把这一切都唱给你听
[00:48.41]已经不记得那是怎样的一个晚上
[00:51.55]不知是小雨还是迷雾 风在耳边回荡
[00:54.49]我们都在怕分别的痛所以匆匆道别
[00:57.31]回到家门口还留着你忘记带走的拖鞋
[01:00.46]或早或晚的分别
[01:01.98]或冷或暖的季节
[01:03.58]写好的剧本又怎么可能会再次更迭
[01:06.50]没说出口的挽留
[01:07.91]看似坚强的回头
[01:09.43]倔强的我们终于在现实前低下了头
[01:12.51]这座城市里 记忆藏在每个角落
[01:15.28]yarra河边 流浪诗人见证了太多承诺
[01:18.41]珍惜眼前 能够在一起的每时每刻
[01:21.32]故事结局里 大多数人都会选择沉默
[01:24.48]也许我们本来就走在不同的路
[01:27.11]那偷来的时间本来也都不算数
[01:29.93]可无论结局怎样我都觉得庆幸
[01:32.74]感谢这一段有你陪伴在我的生命
[01:35.76]接下来抱歉无法再和你去一起经历
[01:38.77]但生活还有许多期待别把自己封闭
[01:41.69]All the best 送给你最后的一点希冀
[01:44.74]放手吧 勇敢向前别管是天堂或地狱
[01:47.65]忘记我但是请你记住我说过的话
[01:50.70]请为你自己而活 别活的那么伟大
[01:53.70]勇敢点大声说出你内心真实的想法
[01:56.71]如今的我们已经长大再也不会害怕
[01:59.99]每一次的离别都让我更加学会珍惜
[02:03.45]感谢你那时给的动力帮我度过最难时期
[02:06.63]时常想起与你一起玩的握手游戏
[02:09.44]抓到之后 你止不住的得意
[02:12.08]我想对于分别我应该是擅长的
[02:15.30]不停的你好再见我已经是淡然的
[02:18.40]每个人都有不同的生命轨迹
[02:20.90]兜兜转转 是否最后还停留在原地
[02:24.43]回忆像是一卷老旧的电影胶卷
[02:27.46]捕捉着每个微笑每次呼吸的瞬间
[02:30.41]那时的我们都在害怕每一天的结束
[02:33.31]好像明天到来后时间就会开始倒数
[02:36.47]还有着那么多的歌想给你听
[02:38.97]还有那么多的故事那么多的曾经
[02:41.89]留了那么多的泪从你的那么美的眼睛
[02:45.22]那时的我们都有着那么真的心
[02:48.02]嘿 不知道你最近过的好吗
[02:53.08]我只想跟你说 我很珍惜我们的回忆
[02:59.14]但一切都过去了
[03:03.99]我希望你可以过好之后的每一天
[03:09.24]All the best
[03:12.14]不知道你现在在哪里
[03:14.93]过得好不好 有没有很开心
[03:17.81]从你的世界里面消失以后
[03:20.78]不知道有没有 曾经被想起
[03:23.73]记忆模糊了 画面消失了
[03:26.84]还能记得起的只有你的眼睛
[03:29.91]音乐响起了 阳光铺满了
[03:32.90]如今的我把这一切都唱给你听
[03:35.94]每一个童话故事最后都会有个结尾
[03:39.36]但不是所有感情都能得到永恒的美
[03:42.46]对于发生的一切我从不后悔
[03:45.22]对于未来美好追逐我也从不气馁
[03:48.30]那么故事就在这里面画上句号
[03:51.44]挥一挥手 再送给你一个我的微笑
[03:54.46]希望未来的你可以一切都好
[03:57.21]希望未来的我也都可以做到

[02:42.69]在你头顶上三尺有神明
[02:44.52]红酒灌入的眼眸布成血丝
[02:46.16]劣质的人类确实缺失节制
[02:48.41]他咬牙切齿想要劫持你的思维
[02:50.25]而我却用前半生来为你写诗
[02:52.16]还记得你们曾经对我蔑视
[02:53.98]像是在夜空中燃烧的烈日
[02:55.76]写出不理智的词太迟
[02:57.44]是枚来不及递出的戒指
[02:59.53]我想要祈求上帝
[03:01.32]想要放下笔头抗议
[03:03.12]可我知道为了你
[03:04.13]身后的空无一人
[03:05.13]是我没有理由放弃
[03:07.02]在回忆里头忘记
[03:08.59]是我梦寐以求浪迹
[03:10.49]天涯远离尘世
[03:11.64]社会乌烟瘴气
[03:12.67]如何金盆洗手套利
[03:14.36]我梦见
[03:14.92]走入废弃城堡
[03:15.85]如画锐利棱角
[03:16.67]躯壳横扫
[03:17.29]是灵魂寻找
[03:18.32]解锁的韵脚涂满
[03:19.15]血做的唇膏
[03:20.03]把懒惰杀死
[03:20.89]把怯懦给焚烧
[03:21.87]烛光摇曳残影
[03:22.73]高脚杯声唤醒
[03:23.64]那些沉睡的动物
[03:24.71]再次掉入陷阱
[03:25.77]掉入金钱仙境
[03:26.60]是封信函天命
[03:27.50]人做天看的协议
[03:28.43]早被自然签订
[03:29.35]就让我
[03:30.69]复活后诉说
[03:31.45]哭过的怒火
[03:32.18]背过的污浊
[03:34.28]折磨中渡过
[03:35.00]落魄中捕捉
[03:36.08]懦弱中蹉跎

[00:23.37]Hip Hop唔系净系Yo Yo声
[00:25.48]你想知系乜等我话俾你听
[00:27.82]1973年有个后生仔o系纽约搏出位
[00:32.40]自己搵地方搞派对 入场费收得果鸡碎
[00:36.87]佢赚几多根本唔重要 最紧要受欢迎
[00:40.20]佢个名系叫Kool Hero
[00:42.47]靠佢起飞 全世界第一个Hip Hop DJ
[00:45.85]佢D唱片 根本冇得搵
[00:48.14]但系系经典所以有新鲜感
[00:50.65]间中佢都会Rap返两句
[00:52.69]舞雷宫咁远D人都会嚟睇佢
[00:55.22]睇吓睇吓实在系太好

[02:11.58]只想哼着我的金曲
[02:13.45]喔妈妈 我不会让妳失望
[02:17.86]喔妈妈 我只是在外地闯
[02:22.02]想起妳的脸在我眼睛闭上 时间在早上

Verse 1
也许你才刚认识我
不懂我的野心膨胀得多么赤裸
这条路上带着个性 态度变得恶性
那些虚的假的就别再闪躲
各种风格只要想要就能轻松驾驭
卡住对方喉咙让他忘记下句
不断寻找突破瞬间和你拉开差距
生活从来不给机会排练话剧
想要合作和我兄弟打个照面
我想看到真的你而不是照片
真正的心从来不用重复校验
但是我最讨厌 太多抱怨
所谓嘻哈专家争着抬起头 
不懂装懂不要理由
只会听歌的品味还装一流
一开始就分出上下游
预言被我编织可以叫我先知
预见未来财富却被现实无情鞭尸
他们说我偏执到底谁懂坚持
能够创造新的流派何必屈服现实
所谓新的流言 只要不听不灵
坚持独立思考 向前不停步行
见证文化衰落 任其不断凋零
它会站立起来 还是下落不明
让我把速度放慢 否则会表达的太过凌乱
任何事都要有足够的耐心和判断后才能给自己好看
我从来不在乎别人的意见我只会走我自己脚下的路
这是我自己的人生不是通过别人的嘴巴来决定胜负
Verse 2
所以那些无聊事情我都不会参与 、我的耐心快要爆发
珍贵的时间被我小心切成两半
一半都给了Hiphop
从来不会理会知乎微博评价
在说什么主流还是地下
如果有人在我的面前挑衅那么
状态会从八神变成暴八
所以麻烦那些没实力的没底气的光听歌的爱装逼的别再Rapper队伍充数
Hiphop不是摆拍不是潮牌不是假的链子不是什么故作高调的套路
听了几首歌就自称OG拿起相机发个票圈进入状态是否太过快速
我用我16岁开始积累的经验和韵脚提醒你这才是该有的态度
Verse 3
从来 不会 刻意 押韵 失去 我本意
崇拜 之外 严禁 丢失 内心 的缜密
追随着SUPREME或者Rolex
可惜忘记说唱本源
真的改变会感到so fly
让朋友都留在你身边
对于我的爱好我从不亏待
阻止任何人对她造成危害
我因为热爱 进化得飞快
风格就像利刃我随身佩戴
已过了年少 带破碎拳套
打碎假的面具还原生活原貌
所谓玩票 可以继续嘲笑
崭新的我代表的是黎明前兆

[02:39.05]想要回到过去你的身边
[02:42.84]说声抱歉或是一句再见
[02:46.36]滴滴答答的时间 岁月无情的变迁

[03:22.19]不过是你我的回忆 怀疑我还没睡醒 girl
[03:25.18]你责怪我说这么大了还不懂事
[03:27.45]像愣头青去咬住道理 狡辩“别人总是”
[03:30.18]我那么放肆 你原谅我过不止一次
[03:32.94]我不希望你转身走后又难过的哭着鼻子
[03:35.69]我止不住的痛 心脏被它掏个洞

[00:21.800]我从人事不知起就不知道怎么解释对错

[00:28.080]要躲避水军评论为了心情屏蔽微博
[00:30.660]你害怕我太强快把俩杂碎撕成碎末

[01:32.880]正好也没有**会跑到我面前犯贱
[01:35.460]别再说多比装可怜再扣截图学曹云金
[01:37.840]我赚了钱就先给女朋友买一个钻戒
[01:41.490]如果我是为了钱就不会拖她一个月
[01:43.770]现在你拿我搞舆论我也要跟你说感谢
[01:46.610]没有分辨力的网友那活该你脑子裂
[01:49.240]约定的日期都没到你竟然说我在诈骗
[01:52.080]不跟你们争论对错因为毕竟我做错了

[00:37:000]那段时间仿佛感觉全世界都是我的
[00:40:000]打你主意的小伙不服可以跟我来干
[00:43:000]死皮赖脸地纠缠着你也已经过去一年
[00:45:000]开始回忆那些美好又甜蜜的以前

[01:40:000]我还是想要给你撒娇陪你说说话
[01:42:000]这姑娘可是我的宝贝有人记得嘛
[01:45:000]想要再次挽留你可能已经太浮夸
[01:48:000]故事开头我来编写 可结局并不理想
[01:51:000]你在的时候我实在 是根本都不迷茫
[01:53:000]你想要自由那我也 不想要去束缚你
[01:56:000]可是那又怎么能跟 梦到你的目录比

[02:41:000]是你教我怎么从一个男孩变成男人
[02:43:000]你慢慢说我开始变得越来越更烦人

[00:16.715](N*gga really wanna die in the night time,是 Xxxtenticion-Everybody Dies In Their Nightmares里面的一句歌词）
[00:19.443]
[00:20.806]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[00:20.806]我是谁？一个害怕被抛弃的人
[00:23.201]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[00:23.201]我是谁？一个害怕被放任自流的人
[00:25.668]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[00:25.668]我一边迷失，一边寻找
[00:28.103]Why U N*gga really die in the night time
[00:28.103]厌倦了狭隘思维的局限
[00:30.690]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[00:30.690]厌倦了可恶谎言的蒙骗
[00:33.124]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[00:33.124]我很痛苦，想把十发子弹射穿我的头
[00:35.559]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[00:35.559]我很痛苦，光是坚持住就让我感到痛苦，
[00:38.161]Why U N*gga really die in the night time
[00:38.161]别问我为什么不再愿意独自过夜
[00:40.670]N*gga really die
[00:40.670]只身孤影，才能看清自己
[00:41.871]N*gga really die
[00:41.871]每一年我淹没在我的眼泪中
[00:43.126]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[00:43.126]我再次炎魔在我的眼泪中
[00:45.657]N*gga really die
[00:45.657]我似乎无法忘记我给予的痛苦
[00:46.817]N*gga really die
[00:46.817]我也无法忘记我给朋友带来的痛苦
[00:48.083]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[00:48.083]终于，我找到了一种方式原谅自己
[00:50.564]N*gga really die
[00:50.564]在我亲手挖的坟墓中
[00:51.859]N*gga really die
[00:51.859]我会在其中慢慢腐烂
[00:53.036]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[00:53.036]我会在其中感受到死亡
[00:55.494]N*gga really die
[00:55.494]我会在其中被人遗忘
[00:56.822]N*gga really die
[00:56.822]无人知晓
[00:58.031]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[00:58.031]我已离去
[01:00.709]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:00.709]我把指甲深深的扣进自己的手臂
[01:02.988]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:02.988]当我虚弱不堪的时候可以呼唤谁？
[01:05.448]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:05.448]当一切结束后我可以依赖谁？
[01:08.004]Why U N*gga really die in the night time
[01:08.004]我的价值在哪里？
[01:10.518]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:10.518]痛苦不断在我心中蔓延
[01:12.961]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:12.961]我找不到任何言语来形容那种痛苦
[01:15.451]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:15.451]独自等待死神的降临
[01:17.919]Why U N*gga die in the night time
[01:17.919]也许是一个新的开始
[01:20.386]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:20.386]没人想亲手了解自己的生命
[01:22.892]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:22.892]最后只有等待生命的结束
[01:25.326]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:25.326]在生命的劲头回头看
[01:27.985]Why U N*gga die in the night time
[01:27.985]曾经多少泪水和虚度的光阴
[01:30.460]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:30.460]在现在看来都是对生命的浪费
[01:32.879]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:32.879]一切都让我死心了
[01:35.210]N*gga really wanna die in the night time
[01:35.210]全部这一切
[01:37.957]Why U N*gga die in the night time
[01:37.957]一切都让我死心了
[01:40.608]WHY?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[01:40.608]全部这一切

最好又最坏的时代
[by:Trap_Girl]
[00:00.00] 作曲 : 前男友/许多鱼
[00:01.00] 作词 : 前男友/许多鱼
[00:23.23]这是个最好又最坏的时代 你是个怎样的你
[00:26.64]我过的不好也不坏 在歌里唱着自己
[00:29.71]这是个最好又最坏的时代 你是个怎样的你
[00:32.67]我过的不好也不坏 在歌里唱着自己
[00:35.64]会哭的孩子才有糖 善良的没有嘉奖
[00:38.62]每天除了调皮捣蛋 就是无止境的撒谎
[00:41.59]他可能是翱翔的鹰 又或许是自负的鲸
[00:44.63]无限的可能 却被这座城市 束缚了向往自由的心
[00:47.97]听不懂大人的对话
[00:49.25]从早到晚 不断的被骂
[00:50.61]弱小的内心支离破碎
[00:52.27]对未知的事物感觉到怕
[00:53.79]能不能还给我童年时看到的那一片最美的天空
[00:56.50]能不能听妈妈再给我讲一次睡前的绿野和仙踪
[00:59.71]还没有准备好就长大
[01:01.15]学会说虚伪的谎话
[01:02.64]学会跟别人讲价
[01:04.05]把困难都自己挡下
[01:05.51]逆耳的忠言要听 做一往无前的兵
[01:08.69]就算很累 却不曾后退 身体里隐藏着勇敢的心
[01:11.93]选定了方向就迈步 带着一直不变的态度
[01:14.63]那些你没见过的 看不懂的 被大家统称为怪物
[01:17.70]前路很多的猜疑 未来还会有更多的谩骂
[01:20.55]看不得你好 想把你打到的 他们总把你的尊严给践踏
[01:23.69]你的每一步要小心 凡事多动动脑筋
[01:26.64]事情要做的漂亮 要把话说的好听
[01:29.62]不断的升级能力 不被金钱给蒙蔽
[01:32.56]成功很难 但是如果你想要失败却很容易
[01:35.72]这是个最好又最坏的时代 你是怎样的你
[01:38.67]我过的不好也不坏 在歌里唱着自己
[01:41.56]这是个最好又最坏的时代 你是怎样的你
[01:44.54]我过的不好也不坏 在歌里唱着自己
[01:47.56]丢掉天真和幼稚 成熟稳重拼凑的更加完整
[01:50.56]那些发黄的陈年旧事 想起依然彻骨的寒冷
[01:53.49]或许我蜕变的冷酷无情 或许我兑现的诺言不灵
[01:56.88]欠下的爱 欠下的债 自由之身 却像在服刑
[01:59.94]刺激的暧昧 金钱的诱惑 像在雾里看花
[02:02.71]感情被摔碎 虚假的酒桌 心被蹂躏只剩残渣
[02:06.06]从小父母灌输我思想 教导我对错是非
[02:08.52]成年后的我 却看不懂 这社会 究竟是白是黑
[02:11.87]这种苍白的无力感 就像纸飞机飞进风暴
[02:14.64]祸不单行 厄运袭来时 从不会给你任何的征兆
[02:17.63]想做个正直的好人 可在人群中 显得特别搞笑
[02:20.83]恶人却有了 冠冕堂皇的理由 说好人没有好报
[02:23.95]相信过 亲情 爱情 友情 却换来身上无数的伤疤
[02:26.96]才发现最懂你的是酒精 还有歌词结尾的双押
[02:29.97]三观被压得崩塌 汇聚一池的梦想 水滴被蒸发
[02:32.94]如果老天在惩罚 为什么连带我未来 一起封杀
[02:35.87]无数次踏破铁鞋 却被无情的拒之门外
[02:38.51]慢慢学会了如何解决 潜规则一直都存在
[02:41.47]心口再疼也只能按着 不想犯错就当个看客
[02:44.51]思考了半刻 就这么算了 怎么对得起写下的翰墨
[02:47.75]难过的 挂上面具 孱弱的 踏上炼狱
[02:50.50]被别人左右的命运就像杀人魔手中的电锯
[02:53.66]对这判罚没有办法 人们对犯法没有看法
[02:56.47]就迎接我的审判吧 敌你千军万马
[02:59.58]实质的世界不支持 也不存在上帝之子
[03:02.61]发生的历史 事已至此 赤子之心方休致死
[03:06.03]不想助长罪孽的智齿 随波逐流不去制止
[03:08.80]只是 这世界暗无天日 何来天堂近在咫尺
[03:11.83]这是个最好又最坏的时代 你是怎样的你
[03:14.54]好吧 其实我过得很坏 只能骗骗自己
[03:17.70]这是个最好又最坏的时代 你是怎样的你
[03:20.56]好吧 我也只能 骗骗自己

[00:28.90]我在电梯里闻到了熟悉的香味
[00:31.30]那时候我会想起你
[00:32.70]我在商场里逛到了熟悉的专柜
[00:34.85]那时候我会想起你
[00:36.16]看着朋友和身边的人那么般配
[00:38.55]那时候我会想起你
[00:39.85]我又是一个人独自长大了一岁
[00:42.13]那时候我会想起你
[00:43.50]
[00:43.74]又是一个人的夜晚（唉 唉）
[00:47.26]又是一个人的夜晚（唉 唉）
[00:51.00]又是一个人的夜晚（唉 唉）
[00:54.64]又是一个人的夜晚（唉 唉）
[00:58.32]
[00:58.50]我会想起你对我说的话
[00:59.97]说要陪幼稚的我长大
[01:01.63]说我其实没想象那么差
[01:03.50]只是有时会逃避说谎话
[01:05.38]我会想起你着急的表情
[01:07.26]在我快疯掉的时候就喊停
[01:09.20]想起你有些夸张的反应
[01:11.10]发几段篇幅很长的短信
[01:12.91]想起你故作成熟地对我生气
[01:14.94]看起来密不透风的眼睛
[01:16.80]你说你只是想离我更近
[01:18.60]才让我有了些负面情绪
[01:20.48]我不停地想
[01:21.27]描述你的时候该用怎样的语境
[01:23.59]我也知道
[01:24.65]这根本不够
[01:25.63]我那些少的可怜的底蕴
[01:27.56]
[01:27.72]只有你见过我最脆弱的模样
[01:31.00]你说这和别人眼中的我不像
[01:34.50]我后悔当时表现的很没肚量
[01:38.04]是因为我只想好好把你独享
[01:42.02]
[01:42.19]如果说我和你之间是场战争
[01:45.62]那你肯定在为某种东西卖命
[01:49.60]我们一起见证了伟大的诞生
[01:53.20]随后一起在爱里被消耗殆尽
[01:56.79]
[01:57.00]我在电梯里闻到了熟悉的香味
[01:59.30]那时候我会想起你
[02:00.78]我在商场里逛到了熟悉的专柜
[02:03.00]那时候我会想起你
[02:04.60]看着朋友和身边的人那么般配
[02:06.90]那时候我会想起你
[02:08.11]我又是一个人独自长大了一岁
[02:10.55]那时候我会想起你
[02:11.80]
[02:11.89]又是一个人的夜晚（唉 唉）
[02:15.50]又是一个人的夜晚（唉 唉）
[02:19.17]又是一个人的夜晚（唉 唉）
[02:23.01]又是一个人的夜晚（唉 唉）
[02:26.54]
[02:26.70]刚分开的那段时间
[02:28.06]一直熬夜和酒精让我变得很难看
[02:30.40]想到不能陪你实现
[02:32.14]以后的选择和决定让我觉得难办
[02:34.22]直到我自己和自己在谈判
[02:35.89]灯一直开的很暗
[02:37.20]只是要试着去慢慢习惯
[02:39.00]只是要试着把脚步放慢
[02:40.84]一个人一步一步
[02:42.29]一步一步
[02:43.20]得到了想要的东西
[02:44.80]在不同的地方看到我踪迹
[02:46.54]人们说我变得有一些功利
[02:48.58]不作解释  自我封闭
[02:50.12]在房间贪婪地吮吸着空气
[02:52.00]一个又一个一个人的夜晚我才知道回忆有多么的锋利
[02:55.77]它让我不止一次的梦到你
[02:57.50]它让我只能在梦里拥抱你
[02:59.47]它让我试图寻觅在宗教里
[03:01.29]它让我一直无声地呼叫你
[03:03.06]才知道再清醒的时候也看不清
[03:05.17]还是和自己在较劲
[03:06.88]寂寞的身体和空虚的心
[03:09.00]就不经意打了个照应
[03:10.73]
[03:10.88]我从未 想你 回来

[00:16.46]快躲进庇护所
[00:18.68]没有人注意我
[00:20.69]把欲望都吞没
[00:24.79]找不到避难所
[00:26.80]会渴望的更多
[00:28.77]像星星在坠落
[00:32.00]keeps motherf**kin right way
[00:33.73]给你生活带来一些改变
[00:35.56]直到到了老了我也不会后悔
[00:37.63]总是拼了命的不想被人埋怨
[00:39.66]我的需求感承载不了空间
[00:41.52]所以久而久之变得会很寂寞
[00:43.59]三分之一的时间给了香烟
[00:45.62]有时一年四季就像是在冬天
[00:47.84]你是否会和我一样
[00:49.56]总是对眷恋的牵肠挂肚
[00:51.39]总是没完没了的数着日历
[00:53.28]希望珍惜的不要逝去
[00:54.99]小时候总是心直口快
[00:57.24]长大了把话塞进口袋
[00:59.26]你和我有堵墙在阻碍
[01:01.23]因为人心有太多鬼怪
[01:05.22]Do you want a chocolate(要吃巧克力吗？）
[01:07.08]I could eat about amillion and a half of these.（我能吃掉上百万块巧克力）
[01:11.27]My momma always said（我妈妈经常说）
[01:13.55]"Life was like a box of chocolates.（人生就像一盒各式各样的巧克力）
[01:17.17]You never know what you're gonna get."（你永远不知道下一块将会是哪种）
[01:20.19]遗憾的是没安全感
[01:21.60]所以关键时候从来不会判断
[01:23.83]只有拜金女才会活得那么表面拿感情来当做她的换算
[01:27.76]她会为了你的包 再为了你的表
[01:29.88]讲她对你一直挂念盼着你的好
[01:31.88]我暗自祈祷 早点有钱买包
[01:33.66]才有更多的HATER会盼着我好
[01:36.00]耶
[01:36.40]你没羞没臊 也无可救药 就跟我一样
[01:39.38]讨厌那些情兽衣冠
[01:40.70]但是比你低端
[01:41.76]即使他们有钱 你也不想高攀
[01:43.90]你受够了 那些让你终究低头的理由
[01:46.48]即使你的朋友跟着那些终究低头的理由走
[01:50.22]你也不会当条哈怕狗
[01:52.24]要隐性埋名去找到个庇护所
[01:56.22]你眼角湿透却还说你没哭过
[02:00.16]是想要起飞 还是想降落
[02:03.91]自己来回味 活的很忘我
[02:08.11]都是在怕 是怕自己没有了退路该付出些什么代价
[02:11.86]怕这怕那 会怕自己活的很虚伪却没能够活在当下
[02:15.90]活在当下 是找一个庇护来安慰着年轻又迟暮的心
[02:19.88]了无牵挂 让我当一只奔腾在空中那顽皮又愉悦的鹰
[02:24.98]快躲进庇护所
[02:26.75]没有人注意我
[02:28.74]把欲望都吞没
[02:32.57]找不到避难所
[02:34.78]会渴望的更多
[02:36.72]像星星在坠落
[02:39.60]Oh u can hate me 是因为光磊落
[02:41.32]哪怕得罪上帝也从未想过悔过
[02:43.46]如果遭遇偏见也不用妄自菲薄
[02:45.44]因为那些虚荣的一般都是水货
[02:47.51]喂 别总是怨天尤人
[02:49.38]高楼虽高我们不住一层
[02:51.41]世界太大你我各奔前程
[02:53.39]让我独自一人看着岁月年轮
[02:55.47]wow 给我个庇护所 不希望有人会记住我
[02:59.08]他们把自己当做是翁中憋
[03:01.66]拿着欲望和财富去填空缺
[03:03.97]我逃离三界外 却活在这个五行中
[03:07.21]我给我自己拍电影 哪怕会没人当观众
[03:12.98]快躲进庇护所
[03:14.91]没有人注意我
[03:17.02]把欲望都吞没
[03:20.81]找不到避难所
[03:22.67]会渴望的更多
[03:24.79]像星星在坠落

[00:24.26]把很多事情忘了 应该要怎么办呢
[00:27.64]有多久没有跟家人一起吃过饭了
[00:30.70]曾经的翻墙逃课 和朋友们偷鸡摸狗
[00:33.61]而如今有多久没有和兄弟们喝酒
[00:36.68]各奔东西 有人上学 有人做了生意
[00:39.70]爽朗的笑声和吹过的**一起飘散在风里
[00:42.70]爱过的女生嫁给了大腹便便的男人
[00:45.63]总觉得人生有些缺憾不能拼凑完整
[00:48.71]如果我有一台时光机 可以穿梭时空见到你 我一定收起我的坏脾气
[01:00.52]如果我有一台时光机 可以回到过去见到你 可惜我 回不去
[01:13.20]当电话不被挂断，如果能重连
[01:15.86]当时间可以扭转回忆定格画面童年
[01:18.96]当日夜不在颠倒，当少了些许纷扰
[01:21.78]耳机里循环播放薛之谦的刚刚好
[01:24.62]不再去自顾的听 收起他自负的心
[01:28.24]看穿那寒冷的冰 再化身自渡的鲸

[01:34.25]当思维变成韵脚高歌风格变得锋利
[01:37.29]不凑巧
[01:38.10]太多的不被看好
[01:39.49]太多的孤独周围

[01:49.35]想重新登机起飞再重新奔跑
